## What is “belief system”?

Before we move forward, I want to be clear that there are a lot of explanations around _"belief, perception, systems, etc..."_, however, I want to be pragmatical with these and other meanings, and give you an easier way (and hopefully a new perspective) to understand them.

First, let's split this _"belief system"_ phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.

  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of **patterns** working **together**, in a certain **order** and for a common goal.

I think the definition of _"System"_ is quite easy, so for the most part I'll focus this chapter to define _"Belief"_, and by the end of the chapter we will have a better understading of _"Belief Systems"_ as a whole.

### If you can sense it, it must be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality; the mere sensation of touch is good enough to know that we are isolated or alone (like floating in the space). So, when we say we believe of something, the first notion of belief comes thanks to our perception, we are convinced that some particular thing truly exists just because it interacts with our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one: _"Sense Perception"_, or perception of our senses. Also, I'll describe an understandable step by step that explains how our cognitive process works along with our sense perception, here they are:

  1. Perceive
  2. Record
  3. Recognize
  4. Expect

Let's think of babies to illustrate the steps above. Babies depend entirely on their most basic way to perceive things in order to learn all they can about their surroundings. We will assume the baby in our example has a vision good enough to differentiate color and depth.

Now, imagine the baby open his eyes and sees a shape for the very first time and this shape does a gesture while producing some particular and repetitive sound.

From the moment the baby is able to see, his mind starts to record everything that can be perceived (like vision, smells, sounds, etc), even though at this point all this things don't represent anything, there's no meaning, no value, nothing but just data. Here, the process of recording starts when any of our senses perceives something, then our mind responses to that stimulation and records everything with all our senses (it's like taking a snapshot). In this case, the baby's mind will store every movement and sound all together in a sequential way, if the shape moves and emits a sound while moving, the baby will record that exact scene with everything that comes after it but, no matter how much the mind tries to record, the baby can't memorize everything in one shoot, only scenes that repeats frequently will be successfuly stored as patterns or associations. The more the baby records the more the baby will be able to recognize. In fact, anyone can notice the process of recognition of a baby simply because the baby tries to reproduce what has been recorded.

If you watch a movie multiple times, sure at certain point you'll be able to predict what will happen next; and believe it or not this is what babies do; they predict what should happen next according to the recording (and the sequence). All repetitions eventually produce patterns and it is thanks to these patterns that the mind is able to predict what's next, finally every prediction produce an expectation.

Once we have a pattern, our mind will try to reproduce it in order to assess we have learned the pattern correctly. The way we assess a pattern is by matching the expectation with our current perception; here's an example.

Let's say someone moves his hands while saying "come" in front of a baby, as you know, the word as well as the gesture doesn't really have a defined meaning at this point, the task of the baby's mind is to transform all that data into information. The first step is to record everything multiple times, then after multiple repetitions the mind would produce a pattern based on the entire gesture. After a lot of repetitions, the baby is able to recognize the pattern whenever he sees it the next time. Then, the pattern will produce an expectation; the expectation here is to identify what triggers the pattern; for that, the baby will try to reproduce everything that has been recorded in order to identify what makes the pattern start or stop. Finally, after many more repetitions, all that data will be transformed into intormation, and the baby will be able to develop a meaning around the gesture and the sounds.

Anyway, that explanation doesn't really describe all the possible ways we learn or asociate things in our mind but, it's just another perspective to explain the cognitive process. Plus, you can test this algorithm with multiple things (like studying maths or learning a new language).

However, sense perception will always be the first interface that help us associate reality and belief but, we can't simply say we believe of something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, there are more complex things that need a better explanation.

### If it is real it must be true

*True* and *False* are values of logic, they both play an important role in our communication to the point that we can (somehow) associate _"Yes"_ and _"No"_ with _"True"_ and _"False"_ as words closely related but not equal. When we think about the word _"Reality"_ it happens something similar in our mind, we associate _"Reality"_ with _"Truthness"_ as well as _"Fake"_ with _"Falseness"_ but, if we want to explain the relationship between _"Reality"_ and _"Truthness"_ we will find it's more complex to explain it compared to _"Yes/No"_. Why is that? I want you to explore this with me.

Before we start I want to want to discard the word _"fake"_ first, a simple example could be when we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another one; and we might call it _"fake"_ based on some conditions. The definition of _"real"_ as well as _"fake"_ is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways (including sense perception) but, the way we identify its fakeness is entirely based on the pre-existence of something that is already real, we can't think of something fake if there's nothing real. But, how do we know that something is real for the first time?.

Think about this, writing is real as well as mathematics, we perceive these realities with our eyes first, we see the shape of numbers and letters, we practice enough until we memorize them, then we develop a pattern to recognize them but, when do we start to think of these systems (numbers and letters) as real?

The key word is interaction.

Interaction starts with perception, when we perceive something for the first time, at first it's just a one way interaction and that's because at first we are just mere receptors; but, that doesn't last long. Usually, our senses tries to response to any perception we receive by sending signals and if we get some response different to what we expect, we start the process of learning all over again.

Here's an example: you write a mathematical equation for someone else to solve it, that person solves it, you verify the answer matches your solution, if that's true, then we conclude that mathematics is a real system; because it's interactive, because someone else is able to response according to your expectation, because the pattern doesn't break, and so on; but, here we can also assume that the other person is part of the system because is able to understand us; in fact, when we learn things that are on top of an existing system, we tend to assume that these new things are also true (or real) just because we already believe in the systems they are all built in. That's the reason why we tend to believe what people say even when we don't truly know all the facts behind their words; we just need them to say something new based on things we already know and we are almost ready to believe anything.

But, as always, we can't just say we believe of something just because it's interactive, there's another _"reality"_ for weird and inexplicable cases.

History has shown people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced anymore in order to be comprehended, things that cannot be experienced by anyone except by one's self, and yet people is willing to think of these things as real. You could say that most religious ideas falls into this category; that might look like it's true but, I think religion doesn't really fit this category. Anyway the real question is: why is people so sure about those mysteries? What process did they follow in order to accept new ideas as true?

I want to answer those questions in later chapters, but for now one thing is for sure, we all share one common reality and we know it because most people can understand what _"reality"_ means in a trivial conversation.

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surround us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing them.

Stop reading for a few seconds and think about the paragraph above for a while.


Ready?

You will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them; there's the rain, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, and more.

If you think "how a bank works", we already know that there must be some kind of process that triggers the cicle of the business. Someone needs something valuable to be stored, secured, and able to be accessed for the owner only, then someone else decides to provide the solution to this problem and you can imagine the rest. This is what we call a system.

The word _"system"_ describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's one thing in common with all systems: they all started as ideas, those ideas were shared through communication, and finally communication started with perception.

Most of the time a single change in a system may affect dramatically a lot more systems; just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple of letters from the alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents I mean everything that can be written (even software). That means, we learn different systems and most of them are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also requires a good building, and the building requires designers, architects, constructors and so on.

### Belief means...?

Think again what _"Belief Systems"_ could mean and take the time to express your own ideas.

Just stop reading for a few seconds.

It shouldn't take too long.

In fact, you don't really need to come up with a precise definition.

It's good enough if you can understand how deep is this meaning on everything you can perceive.

If you came up with an idea already, that's great! But, I don't think there's a unique definition for _"Belief Systems"_ so, here is my own definition:

> A belief system defines a set of systems that we have accepted already as true to ourselves.

Although I like that definition I think it's not good enough but, that's the purpose of the book.
