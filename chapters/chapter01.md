## What is “belief system”?

Before we move forward, I want to be clear that there are a lot of concepts about _"belief"_, however, I also want to be pragmatical with this concept and give you an easier way to recognize this meaning.

First, let's split this concept so we can understand what each word means on its own.
  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of things working **together** (in certain **order**) for a common **goal**.

I think the definition of _"System"_ is quite easy, so for the most part I'll focus this chapter on the definition of _"Belief"_, and by the end of the chapter we will have a better understading of _"Belief Systems"_ as a whole.

### If you can sense it must be real

When we say we believe something, we are also saying that we are convinced that some particular thing truly exists because it interacts with our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic sense of perception and see how it works within our cognitive process. I'll summary this process in two steps:
  - Perceive and record.
  - Recognize and expect.

A good example to the concept above are babies, they depend entirely on their most basic senses (sense perception) to learn about all their surroundings, so here's an algorithm that explains how this process works by using only two senses: seeing and hearing.
  1. Let's say a baby open his eyes and sees a shape for the very first time, we will assume the baby a have good vision for now, good enough to differentiate color and depth. Now, from the moment the baby is able to see, he also records the shape even though this shape doesn't represent anything (no meaning, no relationship, nothing but a shape) at this point. The process of recording is pretty much like a camera, it just put things in memory, it collects all it can collect but everything is recorded in a sequential way. This process is the same for all senses.

  2. Later on, the baby listen something and the shape moves according to the same sound, and once more the baby records the entire scene (sounds and the shapes), but doing this just one time is not enough; babies (as well as grown up people) need this process to be repited over and over again in order to refine this record.

  3. The more the baby records the more the baby will be able to recognize. In fact, I would say that anyone can notice the process of recognition of a baby simply because the baby tries to reproduce what he has recorded. Now, if you watch a movie multiple times, sure at certain point you'll be able to predict what will happen next, and believe it or not this is what babies do in the very end, they predict what should happen next according to the recording. At this point the repetitions becomes patterns, and predictions becomes expectation.

  4. Once the expectation is successful (because it matches the recording), then this recording in the baby's mind moves to his limited conscious and now it becomes knowledge, which means, the baby is able to identify: He recognizes the patterns and expect a result based on it.

If we agreed on the process described above, you will notice that _"sense perception"_ is very important in every human's life, and this same process is being repited by everyone every single time. The interesting part here is to notice how this process is different (by a bit) in grown up people and how these differences changes (by a lot) our entire life. So, now it's time to move to the _"reality"_.

### If it is real it must be true

True and False are values of logic, and they play an important role in our communication, however, there's an intimacy between _"Truthness"_ and _"Reality"_. That's because reality is everything that we already consider is true (or exists), or it's not false, or it's not fake.

A simple example could be when you find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another, but if you notice the quality is inferior; we call it "fake" or "not real". The recognition of real is based on certain knowledge, this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways (including sense perception). But, the way we identify its fakeness is by following the pattern our mind have traced already, if the pattenr breaks then we conclude it's not real.

Since the most basic way to perceive anything is by our own sense perception. We could say: If something affects our senses, it must be real because we can sense the effect (like fire or sickness); but, for more complex things, it usually should reach our cognition first (we must develop a pattern) before we believe it's real or not (like a board game or a language), but again, even in this case that's not entirely true to asses if something is real or not. History has shown people experiencing different kind of misteries that cannot be reproduced to be comprehended (nor learned), nor experienced anymore, and yet people is willing to think of them as real.

Actually, there is no concrete meaning to this idea of reality, and still, somehow most people can understand what "reality" means in a trivial conversation. In any case, one thing is for sure, our sense perception is for the most part a secure way to identify reality, but here is where consciousness enters.

### Being part of the system

If there's something that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surrounds us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are unware of them, sometimes we just act without even notice it. All somehow repeat a cicle and we all somehow are able to affect a system or use a different one to affect another one; and of course, we are supposed to expect results, that's the way we know we understand a system.
