## What is “belief system”?

Let's imagine we're talking about politics, relationships, travels and so on but, while we are talking, you notice that I use some words in a strange way, maybe words like: existence, morality, love, hapiness, etc. After a few minutes of conversation, it seems that the meaning of those words are quite the same to what you already know but, at the same time you know it's not exactly the same, instead, you could say it's quite different. This is clearly a case of uncertainty, so, at this point of the conversation you should ask yourself at least one of these questions:

  * Are you understanding exactly what I'm trying to explain?
  * About the differences of meaning on words. How much can they change the intentional meaning of the entire conversation?
  * Would it be right if you explore the uncertainty of the meaning just by listening?
  * Should you ask for a concrete definition for any of the words that you notice aren't exactly what you think you know?

That is the kind of problems you get thanks to ambiguity but, let me share a couple more of examples so you see to what extend this kind of issues are common.

#### Operation or Sign

We know these rules of mathematics are true:

  * All real numbers can be either positive or negative, or zero.
  * Addition is an operation that depend on two numbers.

But, here is the catch, we use the symbol "+" to denote both: the positive sign and the addition operation. Believe or not, both words: sign and operation; mean two different things and yet somehow we use them in the same sentence as if they were the same without any apparent problem. However, the case here is that there is an ambiguity, so let's see an example:

  * x = 2 + 4

And answer this question: The symbol "+" is a sign or an operation?

Ok, that was an easy one, it clearly is an operation. Let's change things a little bit:

  * x = 3 - 5 + 7

Here is the question: Which symbol is a sign and which one is an operation? This time the answer might be not so clear, unless you already know how to deal with this kind of situations of course. However, if you need to explain this case to someone who is learning maths for the first time, it could be quite difficult. Let's see if we can apply the rules that we have defined already to help us solve this problem.

  * If all real numbers but zero can be either positive or negative then, all numbers but zero have a sign, therefore; real numbers can be written with their respective sign as one single entity.
  * If addition is an operation that depend on two numbers, and the set of numbers includes the set of real numbers, and real numbers can be written with their respective sign then, the arguments for the addition operation can be written with their respective sign.

The propositions above means that it's perfectly valid to write the exercise like this:

  * x = +3 + -5 + +7

In fact you could write this in a calculator and you would get the right result. Also, just to clarify, we are using the "+" symbol to express explicitly both the sign and the operation but, as you may have noticed, the mix of symbols between signs and operations difficults the reading. So, let's define a different symbol for the addition operation: "⊕", the symbol could be anything, I'm just suggesting something that's not quite common in use, anyway, let's see how this little change affects the reading:

  * x = +3 ⊕ -5 ⊕ +7

Finally! It's completely clear now, in fact, if the exercise was a multiplication we wouldn't have any issues reading it, because there is an explicit and not ambigous symbol for multiplication. In this example the ambiguity of the "+" symbol have two meanings: sign and operation, and each meaning has a concrete definition but, once we defined a unique symbol "⊕" and "+" for each specific meaning "operation" and "sign" then, the reading improved drastically.

The next example doesn't have a defined set of meanings, nor it has a specific one defined.

#### Mother or not

Let's imagine there is a woman who is pregnant for the first time, now, let's answer a list of questions based on this pre supposition.

  * Is she a mother because she is pregnant?

The answers must be concretely "yes" or "no" but, what usually happens is that people reconsider their knowledge of the word mother before answering anything. However, for purposes of the exercise, let's answer: "no" and see what's next.

  * Is she a mother after the baby borns?

That may sound a bit convincing but, again, let's answer: no, just until we are forced to change to yes.

  * If she gives the baby for adoption, is she still considered a mother?

For this question people may involve emotions and intentions before answering but, the problem with that kind of answers is that clearly the word have a meaning depending on case, and that's not what we want. So, let's say "no", she is not a mother yet even if she gave birth a child.

  * If she has her baby and also adopts another one, is she a mother for both or just one of them?

This situation is different, she is taking care of her baby and the baby of someone else. Personally, at this point I would say: "yes" under certain conditions. I believe that "mother" is the title of someone who makes sure that her children are prepared to face the world by their own, also, I would add that the meaning of mother implies an affective relationship and much more things on top of it but, I just wanted to let you know that I've got my own conception of the word "mother". If you have a different perspective it's perfectly fine, we are just exploring the issues of ambiguity.

Now, let's imagine that this woman lost her children, it could be during or after pregnancy.

  * If she was called mother while pregnant, can she be still called mother?

The explanation I used earlier would suggest that the answer is "no" and I agreed with that.

  * If the answer is no then, Is it possible to stop being a mother?

Sure it's possible, the first requirement for someone to be a mother is to have someone that calls her mother but, the second requirement is that she must act as a mother.
If we switch the word mother for cop, it's logically the same, you can call cop whoever you want to but, the person must act as a cop so the word actually to make sense.

Now, to solve this dilemma of meanings you could say that we could use the etymology of each words, so we all have a concrete definition in our present date based on the origin of that particular word, however; if we use etymology in that way, we will end up falling into a trap called "etymological fallacy". The problem with this fallacy is that words have redefined their meaning according to society, an example of this could be the word "bug" which can be understood as a software problem, not only that but, also, words depend on language, and there are languages that doesn't have one-to-one translation.

The solution we see nowadays for ambiguity is "compound definitions" as I call it. If we think of the mother example, we will find that we already have words we need in order to refer to any kind of mother: adoptive mother, biological mother, putative mother, etc. But, the problem with these compound definitions is that the meaning of the single word "mother" is still vague. Also in practice, kids are taught to address their parent as mother, and that would be ok if we had a concrete definition for the same word. But, if we consider that the words "biological mother" are perfectly valid to address a mother then, why don't we teach kids to refer their parent as "biological mother" as a single idea instead of, only using the ambiguous word "mother"? I think that maybe the answer is: kids don't need to learn all that complexity at that age.

### The problem of ambiguity

Ambiguity is mostly discussed in philosophy and linguistic, and even today this is a broad topic to debate. The "mother" example looks similar to a common problem called "lexical ambiguity" but, in fact, it is slightly different. Lexical ambiguity means that: for any sentence, there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings; hence, the intentional meaning of the sentence could be misunderstood. However, most of the time the possible meanings of a word are not related, as in the case of the "operation or sign" example; the symbol "+" have two meanings that are completely different: addition and sign; so the ambiguity is supposed to be easily solved by using the right meaning at the right time, which means that the meaning depend on the semantic context.

On the other hand, the ambiguity of the word "mother" could be described as follows: for any sentence, there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings, and all these meanings share a lot of similarities in commom but, still they can differ in certain cases, hence, the intentional meaning of the sentence could be partially understood. As opposed to "lexical ambiguity", this problem will lead you to believe that you understood something completely right but, reality is that you actually understood just a part of it.
Here is an example for you: if we think about the word "god", we will share some common meaning about this word, maybe we could agreed that a god must be at least more powerful than any human, but, at the same time, depending on what we believe we will have many additional or different definitions for the same word.

The importance of ambiguity is that paradoxically speaking, it's thanks to this knowledge that we can clarify many other things based on the procedence of its meaning, words such as love, good, perfection, etc. May have a different meaning depending on what your belief system is, so; for a motivational coach "happyness" may mean that you should accomplish your dreams, but, for a buddhist monk "happyness" has nothing to do with your dreams. So, even if both perspectives seems to aim the same goal, in the end they are different.

Let's define a rule that help us solve this kind of ambiguity: for each possible definition that we can find for a word, there must exist a set of definitions for more different words sharing the same perspective, with the only purpose of creating a system of meanings that will supposedly and ultimately make sense in our world view of reality. What I just said simply means: depending of what you believe, the use of your words may have a different definition, and the definitions of those words must be related and coherently connected in order to make sense in bigger perspective.

If we consider the example about the motivational coach and the buddhist monk, we could take some notes on them:

  * Both have a different world view of reality.
  * Both share the same languange and words.
  * Both have a different set of definitions for the some of the same words.

Remember this is a common problem. So, next time you have a debate, make sure to be clear on what perspective you are using.

### A belief system is...

If you experienced that kind of situations where people is arguing over differences of meaning just because they have different perspectives then, congratulations! You have experienced the problems of belief systems!
Anyway, this concept is still unclear. So, let's split this "belief system" phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.

  * Belief is the act of being convinced that something is true.
  * System is the group of patterns working together in a certain order.

A not about belief, all beliefs are knowledge but knowledge itself is not true or false, in fact; there is knowledge we don't believe like "peter pan" or "narnia" but, maybe kids do believe in this, and, there is knowledge that we believe like "the string theory" or "God created the world". Let's explore more of these concepts.

### If you can sense it then, it should be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality; the mere sensation of touch is good enough to help us understand that we are not isolated and alone, like inside a bubble, floating without any direction into the deep space, away from everyone. So, when we say we believe in something, the first notion of belief comes thanks to our perceptions. We are usually convinced that something truly exists just because we have had some kind of experience with that before.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one: _"Sense Perception"_ or you could say _"Perceiving reality through our senses"_. It's important to understand that this is the most basic way to gain knowledge; even if we aren't able to communicate to each other we can still learn things by ourselves thanks to these basic senses.

Just think about it, if you can't perceive anything, then how would you even know anything? It is a fact that we need our eyes to perceive colors, depth, shadow, recognize letters, etc; we need the sensation of touch to perceive the things that get in our way, temperature, texture, etc; we need taste to recognize flavors that might be dangerous in large quantities, among other things; we need smell to identify quickly when something is burning; I think hear is obvious at this point so let's stop here.

Sense perception is the interface that defines most of our reality, here is an example: if you decide to take a walk and you feel the freezing air outside; that unpleasant feeling is a natural warning from your body to alert you to avoid going outside without a good coat. So, the example implies that we associate the notions of good and bad based on pleasant and unpleasant feelings respectively but, if we only stick with this idea we would be pretty much like animals, and we know that is not the case. Anyway, as always we must ask some questions before jumping into conclusions:

  * Can I believe entirely in my senses?
  * Does everyone around me actually feel the same way as I feel?
  * Is this cold real or is it a wrong perception of my body?

If we consider ourselves as babies, we'll notice that we trusted our senses even before we were able to develop any kind of complex thought. So, the first attempt to answer will probably be: _"Yes! If you can sense then, it should be real!"_ but, Would you trust your senses if you're under the effects of some kind of drug? We know the answer for that but, again, Would you trust your senses if you're not under any drug effects, I mean completely sober?

Let's imagine that I'm walking through the forest and see some strange fruit for the first time, it looks good on the outside and it smells sweet. Next, let's say I dare to have a test of the fruit, and it's simply delicious. Ok, let's stop just right there, in that precise moment I'm not certain how can that fruit affect my health, and that's the kind of information that we can get through consiousness. If the fruit were to be poisonous it'll probably be too late to do anything but, if I were to research before acting the results were different.

Again, sense perception will always be the first interface to help us associate reality but, we can't simply say we believe in something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, there are situations that requires more than just basic perception, such situations depend mostly on consciousness.

### When does something becomes real?

*True* and *False* are values of truth, they both play an important role in our communication to the point that somehow we can associate _"yes"_ and _"no"_ with _"true"_ and _"false"_ as words closely related but not entirely equal. When we think about the word _"real"_ it happens something similar in our mind, we associate _"real"_ with _"truthness"_ as well as _"not real"_ with _"falseness"_ but, if we want to explain the relationship between _"real"_ and _"truthness"_ we will find it's more complex to explain it compared to _"Yes/No"_. Why do you think is that?

Let's start with what _"not real"_ is and let's replace it by simply "fake" . A simple example could be this: when we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another one; we may say such product is fake or not based on some conditions. The definition of real as well as fake is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways including sense perception but, the way we identify its fakeness is entirely based on the pre-existence of something that we consider is already real, we just can't think of something that is fake if there's nothing real first.

Think about this, language and mathematics are both real systems, we perceive these realities with our eyes, we see the shape of numbers and letters, we practice enough until we memorize them then, we develop a pattern to recognize these systems but, At what point did we start to think of these systems as real?

Interaction is the key word, and interaction starts with perception. When we perceive something for the first time, at first it's just a one way interaction, and that's because at first we are just mere receptors; we are just seeing or maybe feeling something but, usually, our senses try to response to any perception we receive by sending signals towards the direction where we are perceiving that thing then, we learn from the responses of that thing and finally we develop a mental map; a pattern of responses. If we get some response different to what we expect, we start the process of learning all over again until we find at least some minimal detail that could help us reproduce the pattern. Sure, this doesn't apply to all cases but it's fundamental for almost all kind of interactions.

Also, there is a way to test if the system learned by any person is a real system or not based on interaction. Here's the description of the test: If two people say to understand the same system then, they should be able to interact only using that particular system. If that's true then, both should come up with the same responses, these responses must be expected to be valid based on the system they are using, only then, the understanding of that system is considered to be real. Now, this explanation also implies a few other things:

  * If at least two people can interact using a particular system then, we say such interaction is systematic; which means: there are rules and patterns to learn in order to interact.
  * If at least two people can understand a particular system then: it's communicable and replicable; which means: it doesn't depend on a unique personal experience but, instead, it can be reproduced multiple times.

Based on the statements above, if both are true then, the system is real because it has proven to be replicable, also, doesn't depend on a unique personal experience perspective, and ultimately, it's shareable through communication. But, before you continue let me clarify what "real" means in this context; it's real if it exists for at least two people other than one's self. When we that something real that doesn't implies that it must be valid, it could be perfectly invalid and still real. Also, valid means that it interacts with reality in such a way that its results are deterministic.

So the possibilities of systems are these:

  * A fake system doesn't exists, such as the forbidden language of fairies.
  * A real and valid system, such as capitalism.
  * A real and invalid system, such as someone really bad in programming.

Here's an example: you're a mathematician and you meet another mathematician but you both don't speak the same language. So, you write a lot of mathematical equations for him to solve them, this person solves them all, after that, you verify that his answers match yours. The amount of equations are supposed to help us reduce the chances of coincidence, so our expectation should be that he must to solve all exercises correctly.

Now, let's analyse the all possible results of the example above; for this we must consider that there are no coindences due to the amount of exercises.

  * If he doesn't write anything at all, or maybe, all our answers are completely different; one of the systems must be false.
  * If our answers are the same then, we can conclude that we understand the same system, therefore; the system is real and valid.
  * If there is at least onw answer different then, one of the systems is real but invalid.

Anyway, there seems to be a field that is aside from any logical method. History has recorded information of people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced anymore in order to be comprehended, things that cannot be experienced by anyone except by one's self, and yet there is people who is willing to think of these testimonies as true. At this point you may be tempted to think that most religious beliefs fall into this category but, the idea of this book is to give you a broader view of this kind of beliefs and help you assess each of these belief systems using a different approach, before jumping into conclusions.

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surround us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unaware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing them. Let's do a mental exercise just right here, stop reading for a few seconds and think about all the systems that have been already mentioned in this chapter.

Ready?

They are a lot right? Also, if we think about them a bit further, you will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them; there's the rain, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, numbers, and so on.

The statement above, includes an implication about systems in every one's reality: we can be part of a system without even knowing about it, the example is clear if we think about nature. That would also rise the next question: Systems are discovered or invented? Well, on one hand the solar system wasn't actually invented, we just translated that knowledge to our language and that's how we understand and recognize the solar system nowadays but, on the other hand, the way a car works wasn't actually out there waiting to be discovered, instead, there was some planification and trials before someone gets with a valid formula. So, I think it's perfectly valid to say that both answers are right, systems are discovered and invented.

The idea of a _"system"_ implicitly describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's a process that all systems share in common:

  * All systems started as ideas wether they were invented or not.
  * Ideas were shared through communication.
  * Communication is only possible through perception.

Something interesting about systems is that, if you dare to push a single change in an existing system, depending on the change it may affect dramatically a lot more systems. Just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple of letters from the alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents I mean everything that we can use to write and read characters or symbols; things like paper, software, stones, etc.
That just demonstrates the fact that, most of the systems we learn are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also, the building requires designers, architects, constructors, and all of them depend on communication.

### Conclusion

Let's recap a bit about the content of this chapter:

  * The problem of ambiguity can be subtle but still profound, it all depends on perspective.
  * Perception is our interface to reality, it doesn't define reality but it helps us interact with it. However, perception alone is not enough.
  * All systems are interactive and we can test the reality of them with interaction.
  * We can be part of a system wether we know about it or not.
  * Systems could be built one upon another.

Next, let's connect the dots. We depend on our perceptions in order to associate reality, now it's thanks to perception that we can discover existing systems, also, if we were to create a new system, it's thanks to perception that we can share information through communication. But, the problem of communication may involve ambiguity, for those cases it's important to assess if we're understanding what the sender is intentionally trying to transmit. Now, assuming that we were understading correctly then, we could test that knowledge using interaction based on the expected results that the same knowledge propose as valid. If we don't assess our knowledge we could fall into the trap of believing things that real but invalid or worse, believe things that are not real.

> A belief system is a systematic set of beliefs that defines a world view of reality.

Before we close this chapter, here is a question for you. Have you ever tought what would happen if you take two words from two different belief systems and use them together without realizing it? Think of the answer as trying to mix oil and water, it simple won't make sense. This is what happens most of the times when two people debate with have a debate from different perspectives, both assume the same definitions of words for both sides. My observation on this matter is that, if two belief systems overlaps in definitions, we should stick to one belief system entirely and reject the other, otherwise, we will end up with a broken belief system; which means: a broken world view of reality.

Here is an example of a broken system:
