## What is “belief system”?

Let's imagine we're talking about life, purpose, relationships, interactions and so on but, while we are talking you notice that I use some words in a strange way, maybe words like: exist, belief, love, hapiness, etc. After a few minutes of conversations, it seems that the meaning of those words are quite the same that you already know, but at the same time it's a bit different. This is clearly a case of uncertainty, so, it's at this point where you should ask yourself at least one of these questions:

  * Are you understanding exactly what I'm trying to explain?
  * How much can this difference change the intentional meaning of the entire conversation?
  * Would it be right if you explore the meaning just by listening?
  * Should you ask for a concrete definition of any of those words that you notice aren't exactly what you think you already know?

That is the kind of problems you get thanks to ambiguity but, let me share a couple of examples so you see to what extend this kind of issues are common.

#### Operation or Sign

We know these rules of mathematics are true:

  * All real numbers can be either positive or negative, or zero.
  * Addition is an operation that depend on two numbers.

But, here is the catch, we use symbol "+" to denote both: the positive sign and the addition operation. Both words: sign and operation; mean different things and yet we can use them in the same sentence without any apparent problem. So, let's explore what issues can this ambiguos symbol bring us; consider this exercise:

  * x = 2 + 4

And answer this question: The symbol "+" is a sign or an operation? Ok, that was an easy one, it clearly is an opeation. Let's see another exercise:

  * x = 3 - 5 + 7

Here is the question: Which symbol is a sign and which one is an operation? This time the answer might be not so clear, unless you already know how to deal with this kind of situations. However, if you explain this to someone who is learning maths for the first time, explaining this situation could be quite difficult. So, let's see if we can apply the rules we have defined already to help us solve this problem.

  * If all real numbers but zero can be either positive or negative then, all numbers but zero have a sign, therefore; real numbers can be written with their respective sign as one single entity.
  * If addition is an operation that depend on two numbers, and numbers include this operation can receive real numbers, and real numbers can be written with their respective sign then, the arguments for the addition operation can be written with their respective sign.

The propositions above means that it's perfectly valid to write the exercise like this, in fact you could write this in a calculator and you would get the right result:

  * x = +3 + -5 + +7

Just to be clear, we are using the "+" to express explicitly both the sign and the operation, but as you may notice, the mix between symbols and operations difficults the reading. So, let's define a new symbol "⊕" for the addition operation and see how it changes:

  * x = +3 ⊕ -5 ⊕ +7

Finally! The exercise is completely clear now. In this example the ambiguity only had two meanings, and each meaning was concrete on its own, so you can switch from one to another based on context and rules but, even if you know when to apply which one, when we defined a unique symbol for a specific meaning it improved drastically our understanding of the exercise.

The next example doesn't have a defined set of meanings, nor it has an specific one defined.

#### Mother or not

Let's imagine there is a woman pregnant for the first time.
  * Is she a mother because she is pregnant?
  * Is she a mother after the baby borns?
  * If she gives the baby for adoption, is she still considered a mother?
  * If she has her baby and also adopts another one, is she a mother for both or just one of them?

Next, let's imagine this woman had a pregnancy loss.
  * If she was called mother while pregnant, can she be still called mother?
  * If not, is it possible to stop being a mother?

Now, in order to solve this dilemma, people need to create composed definitions in order to address each of this questions: adoptive mother, biological mother, putative mother, etc. The problem with these composed definitions like "some-word-here mother" is that the meaning of the single word "mother" is still vague. Also in practice, kids are taught to address their parent as mother, and that would be ok if we had a concrete definition (which is not the case here). But, Why don't we teach them to refer to their parent as "biological mother" as a single concept instead of just "mother"? Is it because it's bad? Or, Is it because it's better for the kid to simply call their parent as "mother"?

### The problem of ambiguity

Ambiguity is mostly discussed in philosophy and linguistic, and even today this is a broad topic to debate. The example above looks similar to a common problem called "lexical ambiguity" but it's slightly different, lexical ambiguity means that: for any sentence there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings; hence, the intentional meaning of the sentence could be misunderstood. However, most of the time the meanings are not related or completely different.
On the other hand, I want to introduce you to a concept that I call "partial lexical ambiguity", which means: for any sentence there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings, and all these meanings share a lot of similarities in commom but still they differ in certain cases, hence, the intentional meaning of the sentence could be partially understood. As opposed to lexical ambiguity, this problem will lead you to believe that you understood something entirely, but reality is that you actually understood just a part of it, that's why it's called partial.

Let me give you an example, if we think about the word: god. We will share some common meaning about this word, maybe everyone agrees that it has to be more powerful than any human but, at the same time, depending on what we believe we will have many additional definitions for the same word. In fact, if we just take a particular word from some religious system, the concrete meaning of this single word may differ drastically compared to other different perspectives.

The importance of ambiguity is that paradoxically speaking, it's thanks to this knowledge that we can clarify many other things, words such as love, good, perfection, etc. So, let's put a simple rule to solve the problem of partial lexical ambiguity: for each possible definition that we can find for a single word, there must exist a set of definitions for more different words including the one we found, with the only purpose of creating a system of meanings that will supposedly and ultimately make sense in our world view of reality.

### A belief system is...

If you recognize this kind of situations where there are difference of meanings based on different perspectives then, congratulations! You know what a belief system is!
Anyway, the concept is still unclear. So, let's split this "belief system" phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.

  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of **patterns** working **together**, in a certain **order** and for a common goal.

Perhaps the defitions above are not enough, so let's explore more on them individually.

### If you can sense it then, it should be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality; the mere sensation of touch is good enough to help us understand that we are not isolated and alone, like inside a bubble floating without any direction into the deep space. So, when we say we believe of something, the first notion of belief comes thanks to our perceptions. We are usually convinced that something truly exists just because we have had some kind of experience with that and our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one: _"Sense Perception"_ or you could say _"Perceiving reality through our Senses"_. It's important to understand that this is the most basic way to gain knowledge; even if we aren't able to communicate to each other we can still learn things by ourselves thanks to these basic senses.

Just think about it, if you can't perceive anything, then how would you even know anything? It is a fact that we need our eyes to perceive colors, depth, shadow, recognize letters, etc; we need the sensation of touch to perceive the things that get in our way, temperature, texture, etc; we need taste to recognize flavors that might be dangerous in large quantities, among other things; we need smell to identify quickly when something is burning; I think hear is obvious at this point so let's stop here.

Sense perception is the interface that defines most of our reality, for example; if you decide to take a walk and you feel the freezing air outside; that unpleasant feeling is a natural warning from your body to alert you to avoid going outside without a good coat.

But as always, the questions you can ask here could be:

  * Can I believe entirely in my senses?
  * Does everyone around me actually feel the same way as I feel?
  * Is this cold real or is it a wrong perception of my body?

If we consider ourselves as babies, we'll notice that we trusted our senses even before we were able to develop any kind of complex thought. So, the first answer will probably be: _"Yes! If you can sense then, it should be real!"_ but, if you're under the effects of some kind of drug then, the answer will change drastically, I would also add that even if you're in a good state, you can't simply trust your senses entirely.

Let's imagine that I see some strange fruit somewhere in the forest, it looks good on the outside and it smells sweet. Next, let's say I dare to have a test of the fruit, I taste it and it's delicious. Ok, let's stop just right there, in that precise moment I'm not certain if I will live or die for the next couple hours, that's because I simply don't know what I'm taking and how can it affect my health but, on the other hand, if I take my time to do some research first then, results will probably be different.

Again, sense perception will always be the first interface to help us associate reality and belief but, we can't simply say we believe of something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, there are situations that requires more than just basic perception, and here is where consciousness and knowledge enter.

### When does something becomes real?

*True* and *False* are values of truth, they both play an important role in our communication to the point that somehow we can associate _"yes"_ and _"no"_ with _"true"_ and _"false"_ as words closely related but not entirely equal. When we think about the word _"real"_ it happens something similar in our mind, we associate _"real"_ with _"truthness"_ as well as _"not real"_ with _"falseness"_ but, if we want to explain the relationship between _"real"_ and _"truthness"_ we will find it's more complex to explain it compared to _"Yes/No"_. Why is that? I want you to explore this with me.

But first, let's start with what _"not real"_ is and let's replace it by simply "fake" . A simple example could be this: when we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another one; we may say such product is fake or not based on some conditions. The definition of real as well as fake is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways including sense perception but, the way we identify its fakeness is entirely based on the pre-existence of something that we consider is already real, we just can't think of something that is fake if there's nothing real first. So, how do we know that something is real?

Think about this, language and mathematics are both real systems, we perceive these realities with our eyes, we see the shape of numbers and letters, we practice enough until we memorize them then, we develop a pattern to recognize these systems but, at what point did we start to think of these systems as real?

Interaction is the key word and interaction starts with perception. When we perceive something for the first time, at first it's just a one way interaction, and that's because at first we are just mere receptors; we are just seeing or maybe feeling something but, usually, our senses try to response to any perception we receive by sending signals towards the direction where we are perceiving that thing then, we learn from the response and develop a mental map; a pattern of responses. If we get some response different to what we expect, we start the process of learning all over again until we find at least some minimal detail that could help us reproduce the pattern. Sure, this doesn't apply to all cases but it's fundamental for almost all kind of interactions.

Also, there is a way to test if the system learned by any person is a real system or not based on interaction. However, as you may have guessed already, this method may not apply for all cases.
However, here's the description of the test: If two people say to understand the same system then, they should be able to interact only using that particular system. If that's true then, both should come up with the same responses, these responses must be expected to be valid based on the system they are using, only then, the understanding of that system is considered to be real; therefore the system is real. Now, this explanation also implies a few other things:

  * If two people can interact using a system then, we say such interaction is systematic; which means: there are rules and patterns to learn in order to interact.
  * If two people can understand it then: it's communicable and replicable; which means: it doesn't depend on a unique personal experience, instead, it can be reproduced multiple times.

Based on the statements above, if both are true then, the system is real because it has proven to be replicable, also, doesn't depend on a unique personal experience perspective, and ultimately, it's shareable through communication. But, before you continue let me clarify what "real" means in this context; it's real if it exists for people other than one's self, this doesn't mean that such system is valid, it could be perfectly invalid and still real. Also, valid means that it interacts with reality in such a way that its results are deterministic. So the possibilities here are:

  * There are real and fake systems.
  * There are real systems that can be valid or invalid.

Here's an example: you're a mathematician and you meet another mathematician but you both don't speak the same language. So, you write a lot of mathematical equations for him to solve them, this person solves them all, after that, you verify that his answers match yours. The amount of equations are supposed to help us reduce the chances of coincidence, so our expectation should be that he must to solve all exercises correctly.

Now, let's analyse the two possible results of the example above; for this we must consider that there are no coindences due to the amount of exercises. If our answers are the same then, we can conclude that we understand the same system, therefore; the system is real.
On the other hand, if there is at least one answer different then, these are two different real systems but, if two real systems share the same fundations and their results are different then, just one of them is valid.

Anyway, as always, we can't just say we believe of something just because it's interactive. History has recorded information of people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced anymore in order to be comprehended, things that cannot be experienced by anyone except by one's self, and yet there is people who is willing to think of these testimonies as true. At this point you may be tempted to think that most religious beliefs fall into this category but, the idea of this book is to give you a broader view of this kind of belief and assess each of these belief systems using a different approach.

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surround us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unaware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing them. Let's do a mental exercise just right here, stop reading for a few seconds and think about all the systems that have been already mentioned in this chapter.

Ready?

They are a lot right? Also, if we think about them a bit further, you will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them; there's the rain, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, numbers, and so on.

The statement above, includes a an implications about systems in every one's reality: we can be part of a system without even knowing about it, the example is clear with nature. So, I think it's time to ask: systems are discovered or invented? Well, on one hand the solar system wasn't actually invented, we just translated that knowledge to our language and that's how we understand and recognize the solar system nowadays but, on the other hand, the way a car works wasn't actually out there waiting to be discovered, instead, there was some planification and trials before someone gets with a valid formula. So, I think it's perfectly valid to say that both answers are right, systems are discovered and invented.

If you think: how does a bank works? We already know that there must be some kind of process that triggers the cicle of the business. Someone needs something valuable to be stored, secured, and able to be accessed for the owner only, then someone else decides to provide the solution to this problem and you can imagine the rest. This is what we call a system.

The idea of a _"system"_ implicitly describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's a process that all systems share in common:

  * All systems started as ideas wether they were invented or not.
  * Ideas were shared through communication.
  * Communication is only possible through perception.

Something interesting about systems is that, if you dare to push a single change in an existing system, it may affect dramatically a lot more systems. Just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple of letters from the alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents I mean everything that we can use to write and read characters or symbols; things like paper, software, stones, etc.
That just demonstrates the fact that, most of the systems we learn are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also requires a good building, and the building requires designers, architects, constructors, and all of them depend on communication.

### Conclusion

Let's recap a bit about the content of this chapter:

  * The problem we saw with communication was partial lexical ambiguity, the same word may lead to different conclusions due to its different meanings.
  * We also learn that we depend on perception in order to have contact with reality, but, perception only is not enough, here's where consciousness enter.
  * Interaction can be used to test the reality of systems, and yet, we can't believe everything that is real until we find out if it's valid.
  * We can be part of a system wether we know about it or not, and systems could be built one upon another.

Next, let's connect the dots. We depend on our perceptions in order to associate reality, now it's thanks to perception that we can discover existing systems, also, if were to create a system, it's thanks to perception that we can share information through communication. The problem of communication may involve ambiguity, for those cases it's important to assess if we're understanding what the sender is intentionally trying to transmit. Assuming that we were understading correctly then, we could test that knowledge using interaction based on the expected results that the same knowledge propose as valid. If we don't assess our knowledge we could fall in the trap of believing things that real but invalid or worse, they are not real.

Now, think again what _"Belief Systems"_ could mean and take the time to express it with your own ideas.

Just stop reading for a few seconds.

It shouldn't take too long.

In fact, you don't really need to come up with a precise definition.

It's good enough if you understand how deep this meaning can be.
