## What is a belief system?

Let's say we have been talking about the economy, ideas, projects, and more, but, while we were talking, you noticed that I used some words in a strange way, maybe words like existence, morality, love, happiness, etc. After a few minutes of conversation, it seems that the meaning of those words is the same as what you already know but, at the same time you know it's not exactly the same, instead, you could say it's quite different. This is a case of uncertainty, so, at this point in the conversation you should ask yourself at least one of these questions:

  * Are you understanding exactly what I'm intentionally trying to say?
  * About the differences of meaning on words. How much can they change the intentional meaning of the entire conversation?
  * Should you ask for a concrete definition for any of the words that you think aren't clear?

That is the kind of problem you get thanks to ambiguity but, let me share a couple more examples so you see to what extent this kind of issue is common.

#### Operation or Sign

We know these rules of mathematics are true:

  * All real numbers can be either positive, or negative, or zero.
  * Addition is an operation that depends on two numbers.

But, here is the catch, we use the symbol "+" to denote both: the positive sign and the addition operation. Believe it or not, both words: "sign" and "operation"; mean two different things, and yet somehow we use them in the same sentence as if they were the same without any apparent problem. However, the case here is that there is an ambiguity, so let's see this example:

  * x = 2 + 4

And answer this question: The symbol "+" is a sign or an operation?

Ok, that was an easy one, it is an operation. Let's change things a little bit:

  * x = 3 - 5 + 7

Here is the question: Which symbol is a sign and which one is an operation? This time the answer might be not so clear unless you already know how to deal with this kind of situation of course. However, if you need to explain this case to someone who is learning maths for the first time, it could be quite difficult.

Let's see if we can apply the rules that we have defined already to help us solve this problem.

  * If all real numbers but zero can be either positive or negative then, all numbers but zero have a sign, therefore; real numbers can be written with their respective sign as one single entity.
  * If the addition is an operation that depends on two numbers, and the set of numbers includes the set of real numbers, and real numbers can be written with their respective sign then, the arguments for the addition operation can be written with their respective sign.

The propositions above means that it's perfectly valid to write the exercise like this:

  * x = +3 + -5 + +7

You could even write it in a calculator and you would get the right answer. Also, just to clarify, we are using the "+" symbol to express explicitly both the sign and the operation but, as you may have noticed, using the same symbol for different ideas makes the exercise hard to understand. Let's define a different symbol for the addition operation: "⊕", the symbol could be anything, I'm just suggesting something that's not quite common in use, anyway, let's see how this little change affects the reading of the exercise:

  * x = +3 ⊕ -5 ⊕ +7

Finally! It's completely clear now, in fact, if the exercise was a multiplication we wouldn't have any issues reading it because there is an explicit and not ambiguous symbol for multiplication operation:

  * x = +3 * -5 * +7

In this entire example, the symbol "+" is ambiguous because it shares two concrete and different definitions: "positive sign" and "addition operation", but, once we defined a unique symbol: "⊕" and "+" for "operation" and "sign" respectively; then, the understanding of the exercise improved drastically.

The next example raises the level of uncertainty.

#### Mother or not

Let's imagine there is a woman who is pregnant for the first time, and answer these questions:

  * Is she a mother because she is pregnant?

The answer must be a concrete "yes" or "no" but, what usually happens is that people reconsider their knowledge of the word "mother" before answering anything, that demonstrates the ambiguity of such word.
My answer will be "no" based on the fact that no one is calling her mother yet.

  * Is she a mother after the baby borns?

That may sound a bit convincing but, as the baby is not able to say nothing for the first months, I would say "not exactly after having a baby". So, it's a "no" for now.

  * If she gives the baby for adoption, is she still a mother?

For this question people may involve emotions and intentions before answering but, the problem with that kind of answers is that the word now has a meaning that depends on certain cases, emotions and/or intentions, and that's not what we want, we want a word that keeps its meaning regardless of the case. So, I would say no, because of the same reason before, there is no one that calls her mother.

  * If she wants to have her baby and also adopts another one. Would she be mother for both or just one of them?

This situation is different, she is taking care of her baby and the baby of someone else. Personally, at this point, I would say yes, she is a mother for both but, under certain conditions. I believe that "mother" is the title of someone who makes sure that her children are prepared to face the world by their own; I would also add more much meaning to such word but, I just wanted to let you know that I've got my definition of the word "mother" which you may agree or not. So, If you have a different perspective it's perfectly fine, for now we are just exploring the issues of ambiguity.

Now, let's imagine that this woman lost her children, it could be during or after pregnancy and now she has no children to take care of.

  * If she was called mother while pregnant, can she be still called mother?

The explanation I used earlier would suggest that the answer is "no" because now there are no children to take care of, and I agreed.

  * If the answer is no then, Is it possible to stop being a mother?

Sure it's possible, the first requirement for someone to be a mother is to have someone that calls her mother but, the second requirement is that she must act as a mother.
If we switch the word "mother" for "friend", it's logically the same, you can call a friend whoever you want to but, the person must act as a friend so the word makes sense. I think that we could apply the same principle for any title: cop, president, teacher, etc; regardless of its legal implication, we want people to act according to the word we are using to address them.

Now, to solve this dilemma of meanings you could say that we could use the etymology of words, so we all have a concrete definition in our present date based on the origin of each particular word, however; if we use etymology in that way, we will end up falling into a trap called "etymological fallacy". The problem with this fallacy is that nowadays words have redefined their meaning according to society, culture, and many other variables, an example of this could be the use of the word "bug"; which up to date can be understood as an insect and as a software problem. The problem is bigger if we consider that there are languages that don't have an equivalent word by word translation.

In any case, in our present-day; the solutions we see for ambiguity are "compound definitions" as I call it. If we think of the "mother or not" example, we will find that we already have a set of words to refer to a mother for each possible case: adoptive mother, biological mother, putative mother, etc. But, the problem with these compound definitions is that the meaning of the single word "mother" is still vague. Also in practice, kids are taught to address their parent as mother, and that would be ok if we had a concrete definition for that word. But, if we also consider that the words "biological mother" are perfectly valid to address a mother then, why don't we teach kids to refer their parent as "biological mother" as a concrete idea instead of, using the ambiguous word "mother"? I think that maybe the answer is: kids don't need to learn all that complexity at that age.

### The problem of ambiguity

When we talk about ambiguity, we are talking about how the intentional meaning of a message can be affected. In a basic sense, any message has a concrete intentional meaning but, depending on multiple factors this meaning could be misunderstood. This problem usually happens because the message contains at least one word such that have multiple meanings. This capacity of words having multiple meanings is also called "polysemy" in linguistic. The solution to this issue is mostly discussed in linguistic and philosophy, and I would say that even outside those fields this is a broad topic to debate. However, my goal is to be able to identify ambiguity and use it properly.

Let's start by explaining what "lexical ambiguity" means. It's a case of ambiguity based on a lexeme. A lexeme is basically a single unit of vocabulary or lexicon, for example, the word "apple" is a lexeme. If we deep further into the specifics and extensions of meaning, this concept can grow and get more complex, but, that is out of the scope of this book. Now, regarding the "lexical ambiguity", you could say that; for any message, there could exist a word such that have multiple concrete meanings; hence, the intentional meaning of the message could be misunderstood. However, most of the time the possible meanings of a word are not related, as in the case of the "operation or sign" example; the symbol "+" has two concrete meanings, both are completely different things: addition operation and positive sign; so the ambiguity is supposed to be easily solved by using the right meaning at the right time. That also implies that most of the time, the meaning of a word depends on the semantic context.

However, if we recap the example "mother or not" we can notice that such a case doesn't fit with the "lexical ambiguity" definition, that's because the possible meanings for the word "mother" don't have a concrete definition. The ambiguity of the word "mother" could be described like this: for any sentence, there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings, and all these meanings share a lot of similarities in common but, still, they can differ in certain cases, hence, the intentional meaning of the sentence could be partially understood. As opposed to "lexical ambiguity", this problem will lead you to believe that you understood something completely right but, the reality might be that you understood just a part of it.

The importance of ambiguity is that paradoxically speaking, it's thanks to this knowledge that we can clarify many other things based on the source of its meaning, words such as love, good, perfection, etc. May have a different meaning depending on what your belief system is.
Here is an example, for a motivational coach, the word "happiness" may mean that you should accomplish your dreams and ambitions, but maybe, for a Buddhist monk "happiness" has nothing to do with your dreams or ambitions. So, even if both perspectives seem to aim the same goal, the pathways to achieve it are different. It means that due to the lack of this knowledge we are prone to understand things partially.

Let's define a rule that helps us solve this kind of ambiguity: for each possible definition that we can find for a word, there must exist a set of definitions for more different words sharing the same perspective, with the only purpose of creating a system of meanings that will supposedly and ultimately make sense in our world view of reality. What I just said simply means: depending on what you believe, the use of your words may have a different definition, and the definitions of those words must be related and coherently connected to make sense in our bigger and wider perspective of reality.

If we consider the example of the motivational coach and the Buddhist monk, we could highlight a couple of things:

  * Both have a different world view of reality.
  * Both share the same language and words.
  * Both have a different set of definitions for some of the same words.

Remember this is a common problem. So, next time you have a debate, make sure to be clear on what perspective you are using.

### A belief system is...

If you have experienced that kind of situation where people are arguing over differences of meaning just because they have different perspectives then, congratulations! You have experienced the problems of belief systems!
Explaining what a belief system means, is often complex because it is not only about perspective. So, let me explain this bit by bit:

  * Belief is the act of being convinced that something is true.
  * System is the group of patterns working together in a certain order.

The idea behind any belief system is that everything makes sense from the right perspective. If you consider that along the way we learn a lot of things from different perspectives, the problem we have later is that things don't make too much sense depending on what you believe, and it's like this because we believe on mutually exclusive perspectives.

That's the reason why it's called a "belief system" it focuses more on the "system" than the "belief" because all systems are supposed to work. Now, just to clarify the meaning of "belief"; any belief is knowledge in itself but, not the other way around; this means that we can know a lot of things but it doesn't mean that we believe in all the things we know. There exists knowledge that most adults don't believe as the existence of "peter pan" or "Narnia"; and there exists knowledge that most adults do believe as "capitalism" or "houses". This also implies that no matter how much you can force someone to believe in something, even anyone says so; if a person is not convinced that such thing is true then, there is no belief, just knowledge.

### If you can sense it then, it should be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality; the mere sensation of touch is good enough to help us understand that we are not isolated and alone, like inside a bubble away from everyone. When we say we believe in something, the first notion of belief comes thanks to our perceptions. We are usually convinced that something truly exists just because we have had some kind of prior experience with that.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one: _"Sensory Perception"_ or you could say "Perceiving reality through our senses". It's important to understand that this is the most basic way to gain knowledge.

Just think about it, if you can't perceive anything, then how would you even know anything? It is a fact that we need "sight" to perceive colors, depth, shadow, recognize letters, etc; we need the sensation of "touch" to perceive the things that get in our way, temperature, texture, the flow of air, etc; we need "taste" to recognize flavors that might be dangerous in large quantities like salt, among other things; we need "smell" to identify quickly when something is burning; I think hearing is obvious at this point so let's stop here.

Sensory perception is the interface that defines help us understand most of our reality, here is an example; if you decide to take a walk and you feel the freezing air outside; that unpleasant feeling is a natural warning from your body to alert you to avoid going outside without a good coat. This example implies that we associate some notions of good and bad based on pleasant and unpleasant feelings respectively. But, if we only stick with this idea we would be pretty much like animals, and we know that this is not the case, consider these questions.

  * Can I believe entirely in my senses?
  * Does everyone around me feel the same way as I feel?
  * Is this cold real or is it a wrong perception of my body?

If we consider ourselves as babies, we'll notice that we trusted our senses even before we were able to develop any kind of complex thought. So, the first attempt to answer will probably be _"Yes! If you can sense it then, it should be real!"_ but, Would you trust your senses if you're under the effects of some kind of drug? We know the answer for that but, again, Would you trust your senses if you're not under any drug effects, I mean; completely sober?

Let's imagine that someone is walking through the forest and he sees some strange fruit never seen before, it looks good on the outside and it smells sweet. Next, let's say he dares to have a test of the fruit and it's simply delicious. Ok, let's stop just right there, in that precise moment he's not certain how can that fruit affect his health; that is the kind of information that we can get through consciousness. If the fruit were to be poisonous it'll probably be too late for him to do anything but, if he had the chance to research things before acting, the results would be different.

Again, the sensory perception will always be the first interface to help us associate reality but, we can't simply say we believe in something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, some situations require more than just basic perception, such situations depend mostly on consciousness.

### When do something becomes real?

When we think about the word _"reality"_, we usually associate _"real"_ with _"truth"_ and as _"unreal"_ with _"false"_ but, is it possible that reality could be false?

Let's start with what "unreal" or "fake" is, consider this example; when we know that some product is being illegally duplicated to be identical to another; we may be able to identify if such product is fake or not based on some conditions. Here, the definition of real as well as fake is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be acquired in many different ways including sense perception but, the way we identify its fakeness is entirely based on the preexistence of something that we already consider is real. We can't think of something unreal if there's nothing real first. If you think about fantasy or fictional character as examples, even these kind of creations is founded on reality.

Now, regarding real things, think about this, language and mathematics are both real systems, we perceive these realities with our eyes, we see the shape of numbers and letters, we practice enough until we memorize them then, we can recognize these systems but, At what point did we start to think of these systems as real?

Based on my own experience, I believe that whenever we learn any system, our repeated interactions generate a conviction of that system. When we learn maths for example, at first we don't think of those basic operations and equations are real. It is thanks to the time and experience that we believe they are real, in other words, we must have a lot of interactions with maths before we accept them as truly real.

If you ask about Jedis, dragons, or mermaids, you can get two types of realities:

  1. Yes, they are real because these concepts exist, there is knowledge accepted about these topics, there are descriptions and tales of them, we have had experience with these ideas.
  2. No, no one has ever interacted with any of them, there is no believable record of such things, there are no reliable witnesses, we haven't had any first-hand experience with any of these things.

The definition of reality is quite complex if we consider that there are a lot of ideas from philosophy on this topic. I don't want to give you any final definition for this, but, I want you to think about a simple idea that I call "valid unrealities", which means that something real doesn't imply that it must be valid, it could be perfectly invalid and still real.

The condition of valid and invalid implies that there must be a way to test if a system learned by any person is valid or not. I believe that this is only possible thanks to interaction. If two people say to understand the same system then, they should be able to interact by only using that particular system. If that's true then, both should come up with the same results, these results must be expected to be approved by the system they are using, only then, we could say that such system is valid.

Following the statement above, the following conclusions should be valid too.

  * If at least two people can interact using a particular system then, we say such interaction is systematic; which means: there are rules and patterns to learn to interact.
  * If at least two people can understand a particular system then: it's communicable and replicable; which means: it doesn't depend on uniquely personal experience but, instead, the experience can be shared and reproduced multiple times.

According to the propositions above, the possibilities of existence for any system are these:

  * Real systems
    * Valid - For example globalization, physics, mechanics, programming, etc.
    * Invalid - For example someone playing a board game in a wrong way, or someone getting wrong answers at maths.
  * Unreal system
    * Valid - For example a fantasy board games or novels, sci-fi movies, etc.
    * Invalid - For example, the forbidden language of snake fairies, an elvish map to the center of the planet, or someone speaking gibberish.

Here's an example, two mathematicians are meeting for the first time but, they don't speak the same language. Later, they receive a test with a lot of mathematical equations, and they are instructed to follow some rules. The number of equations is supposed to help us reduce the chances of coincidence, so our expectation should be that they both must solve all exercises correctly based on the same system they are using. Let's analyze all the possible results; for this, we must consider that there are no coincidences due to the number of exercises.

  * If any of them doesn't write anything at all, or, if the answers of both are completely different to each other then, we could say that at least one of the systems is invalid. That's because, if someone is writing only wrong answers maybe that person is not understanding the entire system at all, or maybe the system is wrong itself, or maybe both systems are mutually exclusive, in any case, if the premise was to suppose both were going to use the same system then, they are supposed to have the same results, otherwise, one of them is invalid.
  * If both answers are completely the same then, we can conclude that they understand the same system, therefore; the system is real and valid.
  * If there is at least one answer different then, both systems are real but one of them is invalid due to that single error, and the number of exercises.

Anyway, there seems to be a field that is outside of any logical method. History has recorded information of people experiencing different kinds of mysteries that cannot be reproduced anymore to be comprehended, things that cannot be experienced by anyone except by one's self, and yet some people are willing to think of these testimonies as true. At this point you may be tempted to think that most religious beliefs fall into this category but, my intention here is to share with you a broader view of this kind of belief and help you assess each of these belief systems before jumping into conclusions.

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit consciousness about the systems that surround us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unaware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing them. Let's do a mental exercise just right here, stop reading for a few seconds, and think about all the systems that have been already mentioned in this chapter.

Ready?

They are a lot, right? Also, if you think about them a bit further, you will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cycle and we all somehow interact with all these cycles without fully understanding them; examples are the rain, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, numbers, and so on.

The statement above implies that we can be part of a system without even knowing about it, the example is clear if we think about natural systems, or more drastically someone planning a kidnapping, in both cases we could be part of a system without knowing about it. But, this also raises the next question: Systems are discovered or invented? Well, on one hand, the solar system wasn't invented, we just translated that knowledge to our language and that's how we understand and recognize the solar system nowadays but, on the other hand, if we think about how the first car worked, that system wasn't out there waiting to be discovered, instead, there was some planning and trials before someone got a valid formula. So, I think it's perfectly valid to say that systems are discovered and invented.

Now, the idea of "system" implicitly describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's a process that all systems share in common:

  * All systems started as ideas whether they were invented or not.
  * Ideas were shared through communication.
  * Communication is only possible through perception.

Something interesting about systems is that, if you dare to push a single change in an existing system, depending on the change it may affect dramatically a lot more systems. Just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple of letters from our current alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents, I mean everything that we can use to write and read characters or symbols; things like paper, software, stones, etc.
That just demonstrates the fact that most of the systems we learn are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital that depends on specialized doctors but also, the building requires designers, architects, constructors, and all of them depend on communication.

### Broken belief systems

Before we close this chapter, here is a question for you. Up to this point, have you ever thought about what would happen if you take one word from two different belief systems and use them together without realizing it? You could think the answer is close to the result of trying to mix oil and water, it does not mix. My observation on this matter is that, if two belief systems overlap in definitions, we must always stick to one belief system and reject the other entirely, otherwise, we will end up with a broken world view of reality, or in other words a real but invalid belief system.

The legal age is a good example of a broken system. In Ecuador, the legal age for anyone to be considered an adult is 18 years old. But, what does it mean for anyone to become an adult?
Let's consider the driver's license, for anyone to be legally able to drive a card, there is a process that evaluates if a person is capable of bearing with such responsibility. The reason we have that process is that we want all people to be aware of all the risks that involve using a car. I think we could agree that for all possible titles we want to apply the same principle. If we talk about someone getting the title of doctor in medicine or an architect, the less we want to hear is someone not knowing what he is doing, or what needs to be done.
When we think about the legal age, there is no process, there is no evaluation, there is no course. So, What are all the expectations for anyone that becomes an adult? What are all the duties and responsibilities that an adult must be aware of? I can tell from my experience that the age doesn't qualify anyone to be considered a legal adult. I would even say that nowadays there is a lot of people who are above the legal age and is not capable of taking the decisions of an adult, they don't act like adults, there are people over 30 that it's not even able to take full responsibility for their own life. This kind of issue should cause a huge concern in society because of this false expectation of adulthood.

The meaning of "adult" is used to define a state. When a person has reached a certain state he could be considered an adult, this state is frequently split into two main ideas: physically adult and mentally adult. Now, in regards to legal adulthood, I believe this is problematic because, if a non-mentally adult is not aware of the responsibilities he should bear, and instead, someone else must take responsibility of that person, then, that non-mentally adult shouldn't be treated as an adult at all, therefore, there is not enough reason to allow such person to apply to any possible benefits of adulthood. Think about this, as adults, we could vote or not for the next president but if someone is voting for anyone with no intention of caring who he's voting for, How can you expect social consciousness? It is the intention of voting what makes the voting fair but, a non-mentally adult voting shouldn't count in the process because he has no intention of contributing to his nation. The problem with this scenario is that they are easy prey for manipulation.

Ok, let's analyze what we have here. The driver's license as well as the citizenship and any kind of titles are legal states of the person, such states are supposed to allow us to do things according to the law. Now, about the legal age and the driver's license, on one side we have people making sure that every legal title or state is valid based on ability, and on the other hand we have people defending the idea of becoming adults based on age. We could rephrase both ideas like this:

  * Assign a state based on the ability to take responsibility.
  * Assign a state based on age.

Both lines of thought define a different system on their own, as a result, both systems overlap on the way they allow people to act in society. So, there is an ambiguity in the way that our legal constitution assigns states. As I said already this dilemma lefts us with a broken belief system, we believe in the system because that's how the world works, but at the same time, the system is broken due to the way it defines some methods of social interaction.

There are a lot of different cases of broken belief systems, however, being able to recognize the problem allows us to act proactively against it.

### Conclusion

Let's recap a bit about the content of this chapter:

  * The problem of ambiguity can be subtle but still profound, it's important to recognize perspectives.
  * Perception is the interface that helps us interact with reality but, it's not totally reliable.
  * Reality is interactive, interaction is perceptible.
  * Systems could be a combination of real or unreal and valid or invalid.
  * We can be part of a system without even knowing about it.

Next, let's connect the dots. We depend on our perceptions to associate reality, now it's thanks to "perception" that we can discover existing systems, also, if we were to create a new system, it's thanks to "perception" too that we can communicate such system. But, the problem of communication may involve ambiguity and different perspectives, for those cases, it's important to assess if we're understanding what the sender is intentionally trying to transmit. Now, assuming that we were understanding correctly then, we could test that knowledge using interaction based on the expected results that the same knowledge proposes as valid. If we don't assess our knowledge we could fall into the trap of believing things that could be real but invalid or even worse believe in unreal and invalid things.

Finally, at this point, I think this is the best definition I came up with for what a belief system means. A belief system is a systematic set of beliefs that defines a world view of reality.
