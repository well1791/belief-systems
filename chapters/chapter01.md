## What is “belief system”?

Let's imagine we're talking about life, purpose, relationships, interactions and so on but, while we are talking you notice that I use some words in a strange way, words like: belief, love, hapiness, etc; you also notice it's not quite different to what you already know but it's still different.

At this point of uncertainty you should ask yourself at least one of these questions: Am I understanding right what he actually tries to explain? How much can this "bit different" change the true meaning of the entire conversation? Would it be right if I explore the meaning just by listening or should I ask for a concrete definition?

The case above exposes the problem of ambiguity, which up to day is still a topic of debate, however, I want to give you some practical examples of this issue.

#### Operation or Sign

We know these estatements of mathematics are true:
  * All real numbers can be either positive or negative, or zero.
  * Addition is a binary operation.
But, here is the catch, we use symbols "+" and "-" to denote both: positive/negative signs and that involves the addition operation also. Now, let's explore what issues can these ambiguos symbols bring us, consider this exercise:
  * x = 2 + 4
And answer this question: The symbol "+" is a sign or an operation? Ok, that one was easy. Let's see another exercise:
  * x = 3 - 5 + 7
And here is the question: Which symbol is a sign and which one is an operation? The answer might be not so clear now, so, let's see if we can apply the statements we defined at the begining of the example, and see how those concepts can help us solve this ambiguity.
  1. If all real numbers but zero can be either positive or negative then, all numbers but zero have a sign, therefore; real numbers can be written with their respective sign as one single entity.
  2. If addition is an operation, and operations can receive real numbers, and real numbers can be written with their respective sign then, the arguments for the addition operation can be written with their respective sign.
That means, the exercise can be written like this:
  * x = +3 + -5 + +7
But, the problem is still there, the mix between symbols and operations difficults the reading. So, let's define a new symbol ⊕ for the addition operation and see how it changes:
  * x = +3 ⊕ -5 ⊕ +7
Finally! The exercise is completely clear now.

#### Mother or not

Let's imagine there is a woman pregnant for the first time.
  * Is she a mother because she is pregnant?
  * Is she a mother after the baby borns?
  * If she gives the baby for adoption, is she still considered a mother?
  * If she has her baby and also adopts another one, is she a mother for both or just one of them?

Next, let's imagine this woman had a pregnancy loss.
  * If she was called mother while pregnant, can she be still called mother?
  * If not, is it possible to stop being a mother?

Now, in order to solve this dilemma, people need to create composed definitions in order to address each of this questions: adoptive mother, biological mother, putative mother, etc. The problem with these composed definitions like "some-word-here mother" is that the meaning of the single word "mother" is still vague. Also in practice, kids are taught to address their parent as mother, and that would be ok if we had a concrete definition (which is not the case here). But, Why don't we teach them to refer to their parent as "biological mother" as a single concept instead of just "mother"? Is it because it's bad? Or, Is it because it's better for the kid to simply call their parent as "mother"?

### The problem of ambiguity

Ambiguity is mostly discussed in philosophy and linguistic, and even today this is a broad topic to debate. The cases I'm exposing looks similar to a common problem called "lexical ambiguity" but it's slightly different, lexical ambiguity means that: for any sentence there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings; hence, the true meaning of the sentence could be misunderstood. But, most of the times the meanings are different.
On the other hand, I want to introduce a concept I call "partial lexical ambiguity", which means: for any sentence there could exist a word such that have multiple meanings, and all these meanings share some similarities in their meaning but still they could be different on extension or application, hence, the true meaning of the sentence could be understood.

The importance of knowing this problem is that paradoxically speaking, it's thanks to this knowledge that we can clarify many other things. So, let's start with this simple rule: for each possible definition that we can find for a single word, there must exist a set of definitions for more different words including the one we found, with the only purpose of creating a system of meanings that will supposedly make sense in our cosmovision of reality.

Let me give you an example, if we think about the word: god. We will share some common meaning about this word: it has to be more powerful than any human but, at the same time, depending on what we believe we will have many more definitions for the same word, also, the concrete meaning of this single word may differ drastically from different perspectives.

### A belief system is...

If you recognize this situtation where there are difference of meanings based on different perspectives, then congratulations you know what a belief system is. Anyway, the concept is still unclear so first, let's split this "belief system" phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.

  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of **patterns** working **together**, in a certain **order** and for a common goal.

I think the definition of _"System"_ is quite easy. So, for the most part I'll focus this chapter to define _"Belief"_, and by the end of the chapter we will have a better understading of _"Belief Systems"_ as a whole idea.

### If you can sense it then, it should be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality; the mere sensation of touch is good enough to help us understand that we are not isolated and alone, like inside a bubble floating without any direction into the deep space. So, when we say we believe of something, the first notion of belief comes thanks to our perceptions. We are usually convinced that something truly exists just because we have had some kind of experience with that and our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one: _"Sense Perception"_ or you could say _"Perceiving reality through our Senses"_. It's important to understand that this is the most basic way to gain knowledge; even if we aren't able to communicate to each other we can still learn things by ourselves thanks to these basic senses.

Just think about it, if you can't perceive anything, then how would you even know anything? In fact, we need our eyes to perceive depth, shadows, recognize letters, etc; we need of touch to perceive the things that get in our way, temperature, texture, etc; we need taste to recognize flavors that might be toxic or healthy, among other things; we need smell to identify when something is burning quickly; I think hear is obvious at this point so let's stop here.

Sense perception is the interface that defines most of our reality, for example; if you decide to take a walk and you feel the freezing air outside; that unpleasant feeling is a natural warning from your body to alert you to avoid going outside without a good coat. Now, the questions you can ask here could be:
  * Can I believe entirely in my senses?
  * Is everyone around me actually the same way as I feel?
  * Is this cold for real or is this just a wrong perception of my body?

If we consider ourselves as babies, we'll notice that we trusted our senses even before we were able to develop any kind of complex thought. So, the first answer sure will be: _"Yes! If you can sense then, it should be real!"_ but, for the other answers, there is a problem here: Sense perception is not enough.

Let's imagine that I see some strange fruit somewhere in the forst, it looks good on the outside and it smells sweet. Next, let's say I dare to have a test of the fruit, I taste it and it's delicious. Ok, let's stop just right there, if I stick with the concept mentioned above, I'm not certain if I will live or die for the next couple hours, that's because I simply don't know what I'm eating and how can it affect my health. But, on the other side if I take my time to do some research first then, results will probably be different.

Again, sense perception will always be the first interface to help us associate reality and belief but, we can't simply say we believe of something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, there are situations that requires more than just basic perception, here is where we depend on our conscious.

### If it is real it must be true

*True* and *False* are values of truth, they both play an important role in our communication to the point that we can (somehow) associate _"Yes"_ and _"No"_ with _"True"_ and _"False"_ as words closely related but not equal. When we think about the word _"Reality"_ it happens something similar in our mind, we associate _"Reality"_ with _"Truthness"_ as well as _"Fake"_ with _"Falseness"_ but, if we want to explain the relationship between _"Reality"_ and _"Truthness"_ we will find it's more complex to explain it compared to _"Yes/No"_. Why is that? I want you to explore this with me.

Before we start to dig into the implications of "true" and "false", I want to want to explore the word _"fake"_ first. A simple example could be this: when we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another one; and we might call it _"fake"_ based on some conditions. The definition of _"real"_ as well as _"fake"_ is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways (including sense perception) but, the way we identify its fakeness is entirely based on the pre-existence of something that is already real, we can't think of something fake if there's nothing real. But, how do we know that something is real for the first time?.

Think about this, writing is real as well as mathematics, we perceive these realities with our eyes first, we see the shape of numbers and letters, we practice enough until we memorize them, then we develop a pattern to recognize them but, when do we start to think of these systems (numbers and letters) as real?

The key word is interaction.

Interaction starts with perception, when we perceive something for the first time, at first it's just a one way interaction and that's because at first we are just mere receptors; but, that doesn't last long. Usually, our senses tries to response to any perception we receive by sending signals and if we get some response different to what we expect, we start the process of learning all over again.

Here's an example: you write a mathematical equation for someone else to solve it, that person solves it, you verify the answer matches your solution, if that's true, then we conclude that mathematics is a real system; because it's interactive, because someone else is able to response according to your expectation, because the pattern doesn't break, and so on; but, here we can also assume that the other person is part of the system because is able to understand us; in fact, when we learn things that are on top of an existing system, we tend to assume that these new things are also true (or real) just because we already believe in the systems they are all built in. That's the reason why we tend to believe what people say even when we don't truly know all the facts behind their words; we just need them to say something new based on things we already know and we are almost ready to believe anything.

But, as always, we can't just say we believe of something just because it's interactive, there's another _"reality"_ for weird and inexplicable cases.

History has shown people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced anymore in order to be comprehended, things that cannot be experienced by anyone except by one's self, and yet people is willing to think of these testimonies as real. You could say that most religious ideas fall into this category but, the idea of the book is to understand why people believe what they believe, and also to recognize those beliefs actually make sense; if they don't make sense then we can conclude those beliefs are false.

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surround us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing them.

Stop reading for a few seconds and think about the paragraph above for a while.

Ready?

You will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them; there's the rain, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, and more.

If you think "how a bank works", we already know that there must be some kind of process that triggers the cicle of the business. Someone needs something valuable to be stored, secured, and able to be accessed for the owner only, then someone else decides to provide the solution to this problem and you can imagine the rest. This is what we call a system.

The word _"system"_ describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's one thing in common with all systems: they all started as ideas, those ideas were shared through communication, and finally communication started with perception.

Most of the time a single change in a system may affect dramatically a lot more systems; just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple of letters from the alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents I mean everything that can be written (even software). That means, we learn different systems and most of them are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also requires a good building, and the building requires designers, architects, constructors and so on.

### Belief means...?

Think again what _"Belief Systems"_ could mean and take the time to express your own ideas.

Just stop reading for a few seconds.

It shouldn't take too long.

In fact, you don't really need to come up with a precise definition.

It's good enough if you can understand how deep is this meaning on everything you can perceive.

If you came up with an idea already, that's great! But, I don't think there's a unique definition for _"Belief Systems"_ so, here is my own definition:

> A belief system defines a set of systems that we have accepted already as true to ourselves.

Although I like that definition I think it's not good enough but, that's the purpose of the book.
