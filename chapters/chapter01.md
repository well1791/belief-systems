## What is “belief system”?

Before we move forward, I want to be clear that there are a lot of concepts about _"belief, perception, systems, etc..."_, however, I want to be pragmatical with my concepts and give you an easier way (and hopefully a new perspective) to understand these meanings.

First, let's split this _"belief system"_ phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.
  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of things working **together** (in certain **order**) for a common goal.

I think the definition of _"System"_ is quite easy, so for the most part I'll focus this chapter on the definition of _"Belief"_, and by the end of the chapter we will have a better understading of _"Belief Systems"_ as a whole.

### If you can sense it, it must be real

When we say we believe something, we are also saying that we are convinced that some particular thing truly exists because it interacts with our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one, which is _"Sense Perception"_ and see how it works within our cognitive process. I'll summary this process in a few steps:
  * Perceive
  * Record
  * Recognize
  * Expect

Babies are the best example to understand the steps above. They depend entirely on their most basic way to perceive things (_Sense Perception_) to learn about all they can about their surroundings and even themselves. Here's an algorithm that explains how this process works by using only two senses: seeing and hearing.

  1. Let's say a baby open his eyes and sees a shape for the very first time. We will assume the baby a have good vision for now (good enough to differentiate color and depth). Now, from the moment the baby is able to see, he also records the shape even though this shape doesn't represent anything at this point (no meaning, no relationship, nothing but a shape). The process of recording is pretty much like a camera, it just store things in memory, it collects all it can collect and everything is recorded in a sequential way. Please notice that all scenes must follow a sequence and this sequence is the most important thing of the recording process.

  2. Later on, the baby listen something and the shape moves according to the same sound, and once again the baby records the entire scene (sounds and the shapes) but, recording this scene just one time is never enough; babies (as well as grown up people) need this scene to be repited over and over again.

  3. The more the baby records the more the baby will be able to recognize. In fact, I would say that anyone can notice the process of recognition of a baby simply because the baby tries to reproduce what has been recorded. Now, if you watch a movie multiple times, sure at certain point you'll be able to predict what will happen next, and believe it or not this is what babies do; they predict what should happen next according to the recording (and the sequence). At this point, all this repetitions on different records produces a recognizable pattern, and thanks to this pattern the mind is able to predict what's next and this prediction produces an expectation.

  4. When a baby preceives (seeing and listening in this case), his mind will try to reproduce the recording (if there is a pattern already), and at the same time it will try to anticipate what's next on this perception. Once the expectation is successful (because it matches the recording), then this recording in the baby's mind moves to his limited conscious and now it becomes knowledge, which means: now the baby is able to identify; or in other words: the baby recognizes the patterns and expect a result based on them.

That's the reason why it's important to repeat things like pronuntiation or movements to babies. However, this process doesn't really describes all the possible ways we learn or asociate things in our mind, it's just another perspective to explain a basic process of our mind. Plus, you can test this algorithm with multiple things (like studying maths or learning a new language).

However, we can't just say we believe of something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, but, our senses are the most basic interface that introduces us to reality, but what is reality?

### If it is real it must be true

True and False are values of logic, they play an important role in our communication to the point where we can even relate "Yes" and "No" with "True" and "False"; even thou they are not exactly the same we know they have some relationship. When we think about the word _"Reality"_ our mind associates it with _"Truthness"_ as well as _"Fake"_ with _"Falseness"_, this relationship is more complex than just "Yes/No" but, why is that?. I want you to explore this with me by starting with this simple concept: reality is everything that we already consider is true to exists, or simply it's not fake.

A simple example for the word "fake" could be like this: When we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another; we might call it _"fake"_ or _"not real"_. The recognition of real is based on certain knowledge, this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways (including sense perception) but, the way we identify its fakeness is by following the pattern that our mind have already traced, so, if the pattern breaks then we conclude it's not real. If you think of _"how to recognize a fake mobile phone?"_, the pattern in our mind shows a list of things to look for, then we check and confirm that everything responses with the expected pattern, otherwise, we conclude that it's fake. However, fake is based on the assumption that you know something is real already but, How do we know that something is real for its first time?.

As stated before, the most basic way is by _"Sense Perception"_, if we can sense it then it must be real (to us at least); like sensing light and colors, or sensing warm and cold, or listening a dog and bird, or having headache, if you are able to perceive any single thing then it must be real to that sense. Think about this: we know smells exists not because we see them or touch them but because just one of our senses is able to perceive it.

But then there's another way to perceive reality, for instance: writing is real, as well as mathematics. We perceive these realities with our eyes first, we see the shapes of numbers and letters, we practice enough times until we memorize them, then we develop a pattern to recognize them but, When do we start to think of these systems (numbers and letters) as real?

The key word is interaction.

When you pereceive something for the first time, there's just a one way interaction, we are mere receptors. Basically, our senses responses to the perception, then send that signal to our mind and that's how we interact with basic things, but for complex things with must also send signals.

Whenever we interact, we usually expect that the other part responses by following an expectation, only then, if that response matches our expectation then we start to assume that there's a pattern and it is true (simply because it doesn't break the expectation). Here's an example: You write a mathematical equation for someone else to solve it, that person solves it, you verify the answer matches your response, if that's true then that system is real because it's interactive. In fact, when we learn things that are on top of an existing reality, we tend to assume that this new things are also true (real), that's the reason why we believe a lot of people, because they say things based on other things that we have believe already, so when there's a new concept we tend to think of them as true.

Anyway, there's another _"reality"_. History has shown people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced in order to be comprehended, things that cannot even be experienced anymore, and most of the time these things are just personal experiences, and yet people is willing to think of them as real. You could say that most religious ideas falls into this category. But how are they so sure about this? What process did they follow in order to accept this ideas as true?

I want to answer those questions in later chapters, but for nwo one thing is for sure, we all share one common reality, we know it because most people can understand what "reality" means in a trivial conversation, like our language, or politics, or technology.

### Being part of the system

If there's something that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surrounds us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completeley unware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing it. If you think about this for a while, you will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them. There's the rain, basic maths, the process of eating and sleeping, the night and sun rising, and more.

If you think of how a bank works, we already know that there must be some kind of process that triggers the cicle of the business; someone needs something to be stored, secured, and able to access for the owner, then someone else decides to provide the solution to this problem and you can imagine the rest. This is what we call a system.

The word _"system"_ describes a lot of rules, conditions, processes, decisions and more things, but there's one thing in common with all systems: they all started with a simple and single idea (whatever it may be), that idea started with communication (because that's how we interact each other for the first time), and communication started with perception.

Systems sometimes affect other systems; like removing a letter from the alphabet it would trigger a lot of changes on all documents written in that particular language. In fact, we learn different systems and most of them are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also requires a good building, the building requires a designer and constructors and so on.

### Conclusion

If think again "Belief Systems", take the time to think of it and express your own ideas.

I'll leave you some time to think about it.

Just stop reading for a few seconds.

Ok!

I don't think there's a unique definition to this idea but, here are my two cents: Belief systems are every system we have accepted already as true to ourselves. I think the concept is good but not enough, and that's why the rest of the chapters are important.
