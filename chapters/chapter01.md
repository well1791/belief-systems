## What is “belief system”?

Before we move forward, I want to be clear that there are a lot of concepts about _"belief, perception, systems, etc..."_, however, I want to be pragmatical with theses and many more concepts, and give you an easier way (and hopefully a new perspective) to understand these meanings.

First, let's split this _"belief system"_ phrase so we can understand what each word means on its own.
  * Belief is the act of being **convinced** that something is **true** because we **think** of it as **real**.
  * System is the **group** of **patterns** working **together**, in a certain **order** and for a common goal.

I think the definition of _"System"_ is quite easy, so for the most part I'll focus this chapter to  define _"Belief"_, and by the end of the chapter we will have a better understading of _"Belief Systems"_ as a whole.

### If you can sense it, it must be real

Our senses are our first contact with reality, for example: the mere sensation of touch is enough to understand that we are not alone. So, when we say we believe something, the firt notion of belief comes thanks to our perception, which means: we are convinced that some particular thing truly exists because it interacts with our perception.

There are multiple and different ways to perceive things, but I want you to focus on the most basic one, which is _"Sense Perception"_. Also, I'll be sharing with what I think is an understandable process that explains how our cognitive process:

  * Perceive
  * Record
  * Recognize
  * Expect

Let's think of babies to illustrate the steps above, babies depend entirely on their most basic way to perceive things in order to learn all they can about their surroundings.

Now, we will assume the baby has a good vision for now (good enough to differentiate color and depth). So imagine the baby open his eyes and sees a shape for the very first time and shape does a gesture while producing some particular and repetitive sound, from the moment the baby is awake, his mind starts to record everything that can be perceived, even though, at this point shapes, sounds, smells, etc... don't represent anything, there's no meaning, no value, nothing but just a data. Here, the process of recording starts when any of our senses (nose, eyes, hears, etc...) perceives something, then our mind responses to that stimulation and records everything for all senses, it's like a snapshot. So in this case, the baby's mind wil store every movement and sound all together in a sequential way, if the shape moves and emits a sound while moving, the baby will record that exact scene with everything that comes after but, only scenes that repeats the most will be successfuly stored as patterns or associations.

The more the baby records the more the baby will be able to recognize. In fact, anyone can notice the process of recognition of a baby simply because the baby tries to reproduce what has been recorded (sound or movement, whetever). Now, if you watch a movie multiple times, sure at certain point you'll be able to predict what will happen next, and believe it or not this is what babies do; they predict what should happen next according to the recording (and the sequence). At this point, all these repetitions on different records produces a recognizable pattern, and thanks to this pattern the mind is able to predict what's next, and finally this prediction produce an expectation.

Once we have a pattern, our mind will try to reproduce it. The way we assess that a pattern is correct is by matching the expectation (based on the pattern) with our current perception here's an example, the baby have developed a pattern like this: someone moves his hands while saying "come" but, the word as well as the gesture doesn't really have a defined meaning at this point because the mind needs to transform all these data into information, so the baby do whatever he can do, and associates the responses from the shape everytime the baby does takes a different action, the more the response repeats the more the baby develops a meaning.

So, This recording in the baby's mind moves to his limited conscious and now it becomes knowledge, which means: now the baby is able to identify; or in other words: the baby recognize a pattern and expect a result based on it. That's the reason why it's important to repeat things like pronuntiation with gestures to babies.

Anyway, that explanation doesn't really describes all the possible ways we learn or asociate things in our mind but, it's just another perspective to explain one of the basic process of our mind. Plus, you can test this algorithm with multiple things (like studying maths or learning a new language).

However, sense perception is the first interface that help us associate reality and belief but, we can't just say we believe of something just because we can perceive it with our basic senses, there are mor complex things that needs a different explanation.

### If it is real it must be true

*True* and *False* are values of logic, they both play an important role in our communication to the point where we can somehow associate "Yes" and "No" with "True" and "False" as things closely related but not equal. When we think about the word _"Reality"_ it happens something similar in our, we associate _"Reality"_ with _"Truthness"_ as well as _"Fake"_ with _"Falseness"_ but, if we wan't to explain this relationship we will find it is more complex than just "Yes/No". Why is that?. I want you to explore this with me by starting with this simple concept: **Reality is everything that we already consider is true to exists** (or simply it's not fake).

A simple example for the word _"fake"_ could be like this: When we find some product is being duplicated to be identical to another; we might call it _"fake"_ or _"not real"_. The definition of real is based on certain specific knowledge, and this knowledge could be adquired in many different ways (including sense perception) but, the way we identify its fakeness is by following the pattern that our mind have already traced, so, if the pattern breaks then we conclude it's not real. However, _"fake"_ is based on the assumption that you know something is _"real"_ already but, How do we know that something is real for the first time?.

Think about this: writing is real, as well as mathematics. We perceive these realities with our eyes first, we see the shapes of numbers and letters, we practice enough times until we memorize them, then we develop a pattern to recognize them but. When do we start to think of these systems (numbers and letters) as real?

The key word is interaction.

And, interaction starts with perception, when we perceive something for the first time, there's just a one way interaction, at first we are just mere receptors but that doesn't last long, because we tend to transform data into information. Then we move to the step two: we do a two way interaction. Usually, our senses tries to response to any perception, we send signals and expect a response in order to develop a pattern, and that pattern needs to be tested to finally consider it information (or knowledge).

So, whenever we interact, we usually expect that the other part responses according to a particular pattern, only then, if that response matches our expectation then we start to assume that this particular pattern is true. Here's an example: You write a mathematical equation for someone else to solve it, that person solves it, you verify the answer matches your response, if that's true then we conclude that system (group of patterns) is real because it's interactive, because someone else responses according to our expectation, because the pattern doesn't break, and so on; but, we also assume the other person is part of the system because is able to understand what we already understand. In fact, when we learn things that are on top of an existing system, we tend to assume that these new things are also true (real) because we already believe in the system they are built in, that's the reason why we tend to believe a lot of people even thou we don't truly know their background or facts, we just need them to say new things based on old things we have believe already.

But, as always, there's another _"reality"_.

History has shown people experiencing different kind of mysteries that cannot be reproduced in order to be comprehended, things that cannot even be experienced anymore, and most of the time these things are just personal experiences, and yet people is willing to think of them as real. You could say that most religious ideas falls into this category. But how are they so sure about this? What process did they follow in order to accept this ideas as true?

I want to answer those questions in later chapters, but for now one thing is for sure, we all share one common reality, and we know it because most people can understand what "reality" means in a trivial conversation, like languages, or politics, or technology, etc...

### Being part of the system

One thing that amazes me, it's our implicit conscious about the systems that surrounds us. Systems are easy to identify and yet we are completely unware of them, most of the time we just act without even noticing it.

Stop reading for a few seconds and think about this for a while, you will find that pretty much everything we know somehow repeats a cicle and we all somehow interact with all these cicles without fully understanding them. There's the rain, mathematics, eating and sleeping, the sunset and sunrise, and more.

If you think of how a bank works, we already know that there must be some kind of process that triggers the cicle of the business; someone needs something valuable to be stored, secured, and able to be accessed for the owner only, then someone else decides to provide the solution to this problem and you can imagine the rest. This is what we call a system.

The word _"system"_ describes a set of rules, conditions, processes, decisions, etc... But, there's one thing in common with all systems: they all started as ideas, those ideas were shared through communication, and finally communication started with perception.

Most of the time a single change in a system affects dramatically a lot more systems. Just imagine what would happen if we remove a couple letters from the alphabet? It would trigger a lot of changes across all existing documents written in that particular language, and by documents I mean everything that can be written (even software). That means we learn different systems and most of them are built on top of multiple other systems; like a hospital which depends on specialized doctors but also requires a good building and the building requires designers, architects, constructors and so on.

### Belief means...?

Now, think again what _"Belief Systems"_ could mean and take the time to express your own ideas.

Just stop reading for a few seconds.

It shouldn't take too long.

In fact, you don't really need to come up with a definition.

It's good enough if you can understand how deep is this meaning on everything you can perceive.

But, if you came up with a definition that's great! Congrats for that!

Anyway, I don't think there's a unique definition _"Belief Systems"_, so here are my two cents:
> Belief systems defines a set of systems that we have accepted already as true to ourselves.
I think the concept is partially good so it means it's not good enough; that's why the rest of the chapters are important.
