## How does a "Belief System" works?

The question is ambiguous. I'm not trying to explain how a particular belief system works, but I want to explain how we start believing on some system, but by explaining that you'll understand how a beliefe system works in our mind.

Here are the steps that will help you understand a lot better your current belief systems:
  1. Authority
  2. Source
  3. Judgement

And finally there's **Act** but, we that's step doesn't need an explanation.

The first one **Authority** is the base of them. Hopefully by understanding the first one, the rest of the steps will become easier to understand.

### Authority
