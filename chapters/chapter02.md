## How does a "Belief System" works?

The question is ambiguous. I'm not trying to explain how a particular belief system works, but I want to explain how we start believing on some system but, by explaining that we'll be able to understand how a belief system works within our mind.

Here are the steps that will help you understand a lot better your current belief systems:
  1. Authority
  2. Source
  3. Judgement

The list above should include a fourth one: **Act** but, that step doesn't really need a deep explanation. However, the first one in the list: **Authority**, is the base of everything. Hopefully by understanding the first concept, the rest of the steps will become easier.

### Authority

As this is the most important concept on this book, this chapter could take a lot to fully describe what it implies, so I'll try my best to be concise and provide as many examples as I could.

Authority is the ability to give orders, and of course, expect them to be fulfilled; otherwise authority makes no sense. The word authority is directly related with two other words: obedience and will. If there is no obedience then authority is not effective, which means; there's no authority. And, if there is no will then there is no order, hence, there's no need for authority.

The relationship between "authority" and "obedience" is the most important part of any belief system, the relationship with "will" is always implicit. Any time we follow an order, we are fulfilling someone else's will, plus, we obey because we consider that person is an authority already. But, then what happens when we disobey?

Truth is: we are always obeying an authority whether we like it or not.

When we disobey an authority is just because there's a higher authority we want to obey, so in the end we actually choose who to obey. Now you may think: "Well, in my experience I can decide what orders to obey from the same person (authority), I don't really have obey all orders from a specific person". The thing is, if you disobey someone, you're actually obeying someone else, and that "someone else" is your own person. From the moment you think that some rule or command from the authority doesn't seem to be good, you're judging authority with your own authority, so in the end you'll end up obeying to yourself.

But let's recap what we discoveed at this point:
  * We are always obeying an authority.
  * There are two kind of authorities: One's self and others (parents, laws, bosses, etc).
  * Exists a hierarchy between authorities.
  * We decide how the hierarchy should be.

I think it's fair enough to say that at certain age, we all tend to trust more on our own authority than any other authority
