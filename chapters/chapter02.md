## How do we develop a belief system?

Developing a belief system is quite confusing at first but completely logic, here are the steps that will help you understand a lot better your current belief systems:

  1. Authority
  2. Source
  3. Judgement

The list above should include a fourth one: **Act** but, that step doesn't really need a deep explanation. However, the first one in the list: **Authority**, is the base of everything. Hopefully by understanding the first concept, the rest of the steps will become easier.

### Authority

As this is the most important concept on this book, this chapter could take a lot of pages to fully describe what it implies but, I'll try my best to be concise and provide as many clear examples as I could.

Authority is the ability to give orders, and of course, expect them to be fulfilled; otherwise authority makes no sense. The word authority is directly related with two other words: obedience and will. First, if there is no obedience then authority is not effective, which means; there's no authority at all. Second, if there is no will then there is no order, hence, there's no need for authority.

The relationship between _"authority"_ and _"will"_ is always implicit; in fact, any time we follow an order, we are fulfilling someone else's will. On the other hand, _"obedience"_ is the most effective way to recognize authority; whenever we obey it's because we consider that some order came from an recognized authority. If you think about the laws of a country as _"will"_ you'll find that these laws exist because they were written by people and in the end all laws are the agreement of multiple people with different ideas, the _"obedience"_ of any law is possible thanks the habit or tradition.

Ok, the explanation above looks fair enough but, how do we explain disobedience? Answer is: we are always obeying an authority whether we like it or not.

Wenever we disobey an authority is just because there's a higher authority we want to obey, so in the end we actually choose to obey the authority we like the most. Now you may think: "Well, in my experience I can decide wheter to obey or not orders from the same authority, I don't really have obey all orders from a specific authority". Fair enough but, the thing is: If you disobey an authority, you're actually obeying someone else, and that "someone else" could be our own authority (your own will). The moment you think that some rule or command from the current authority doesn't looks good or right, you're judging authority based on your own criteria, and if your criteria is more convincing, in the end you'll end up obeying to yourself.

## How to become authority

Authority implies power and all existing authorities represent power, but there are three ways to obtain such power:

  1. Fear
  2. Admiration
  3. Tradition

Fear is the most basic one because at first it doesn't require any interaction just perception. Imagine you're walking the street and someone is comming your way, and let's say this person has marks on his face, is taller than you and looks like a bodybuilder. In my case, my first impression is fear, not because I'm thinking that person is going to do something bad to me, but because I recognize myself in a physical disadvantage; it may be because of his height, or muscles, or and my lack of ability to fight of course, plus, if I think about the marks on his face; two things come to my mind: whether this person is really unlucky and had a lot of accidents, or those marks are product of recurrent fights, in either case the person isn't actually doing anything but everything it's inside my head.

In this example just because I perceive myself weaker than him and I don't like to be damaged, I'll try to avoid any possible conflict, people call this effect _"survival instinct"_. However, if this person threatens me I'll try to obey as much as possible, not because I like it but because I fear what would happen if don't obey.

Even if fear is a possible way to obtain the power of authority, the nature instinct of human beings is to overcome difficulties, that means; eventually fear won't be enough to keep the same power.

Another way to obtain power is through admiration, which I personally think is the most effective one. When people obey orders because of admiration there is always a pleasant attitude from the obeying part, a willingness to step forward and be the first to obey, this is the kind of power you'll notice in what is commonly know as _"natural leaders"_. We usually follow this kind of people because of their ideals.

## Two different authorities with same hierarchy can't coexist.

## Obedience implies conviction

## Recap

At this point we have a lot of information about authority; let's recap a little bit and see what we have already:
  1. We are always obeying an authority, that includes our own will as authority.
  2. There's a hierarchy between authorities, there's always a higher authority.
  3. We decide the hierarchy of our authorities.

I think it's fair enough to say that at certain age, we all tend to trust more on our own authority than any other authority but, when do we start developing our own criteria?
