## How do we develop a belief system?

Developing a belief system is quite confusing at first but completely logic, here are the steps that I think explain all you need to know in order to understand your current belief systems:

  1. Authority
  2. Source
  3. Judgement

The list above should include a fourth one: **Act** but, that step doesn't really need a deep explanation. However, the first one in the list: **Authority**, is the base of everything. Hopefully by understanding the first concept, the rest of the steps will become easier.

### Authority

The word authority is commonly associated to some kind of leadership or mandatory role by some government; and that's a partially good association but not enough to understand complex situations. In my experience; whenever we recognize something or someone is already considered an authority we understand that there might be bad consequences if we don't fully obey that authority but, there are cases where nothing wrong or bad happens if we don't obey; that's because authority is not about the person who gives the order but it's us who decide whether we recognize someone as authority or not, authority is our decision, we choose who and what to obey. Now, there are circunstances where we obey because of fear (we are forced to do so), but even in that particular case there's another possibility; we can just go against the authority by doing nothing and instead we are free to do our own will; even if that means there will be bad consequences but, this just means: in the end we choose who to obey.

The introduction might look contradictory at first and you might have a lot of questions for now, so let's start step by step.

Authority is the ability to give orders, and of course, all authority must expect their orders to be fulfilled; otherwise authority will make no sense. A simple example: if you command someone to do something and that person doesn't do anything, then it's clear that you are not an authority to that person (even if the law says so). The word authority is directly related with two other words: obedience and will. First, if there is no obedience, then we can say the authority is not effective, which means: that is not an actual authority at all because authority must obeyed in the moment the order has been given. Second, if we don't feel any will or desire that we want to be fulfilled, then there is no need for us to give an order, hence, because of our lack of will there's no need to have authority.

The relationship between _"authority"_ and _"will"_ is always implicit; in fact, any time we fulfill an order, we are fulfilling someone else's will. Let's take the civil laws as example; these laws exist because they were the agreement of multiple people, which means; the origin comes from some people's will. On the other hand there's _"obedience"_, which I think is the most effective way to recognize an authority. Whenever we obey it's because we consider that some order came from a recognized authority (that recognition comes from us). If you think about someone giving an order multiple times, the longer the authority wait for his order to be fulfilled, the sooner you start to realize that this authority is not effective; to me this example looks like the authority is not giving an order but requesting a favor.

But, how do we explain the relationship between authority and disobedience? Answer is: We are always obeying an authority whether we like it or not.

Wenever we disobey an authority is just because there's a higher authority we want to obey, so in the end we actually choose to obey the authority we like the most. Now you may think: "Well, in my experience I can decide whether to obey or not orders from the same authority, I don't really have obey all orders from a specific authority". Fair enough but, the thing is: If you disobey an authority, you're actually obeying someone else, and that "someone else" could be your own authority (your own will). The moment you think that some rule or command from the current authority doesn't looks good or right, you're judging authority based on your own criteria, and if your criteria is more convincing or appealing, in the end you'll end up obeying to yourself.

## Obedience implies conviction

As we said before, obedience is the most effective way to recognize authority but it's not the only way. Sometimes you don't need to witness someone obeying every single order to assume that some particular authority is effective or not, everything relies on conviction.

Obedience is the act of fulfilling an order. But, even if the meaning fits, the most important thing apart from obedience itself is attitude. The importance of attitude over obedience is that, in the end it's attitude what defines our conviction of authority. With a good attitude we could say that whenever we are going to fulfill someone else's will, we do it because we find pleaure in doing it, we do it because we want to be recognize by the authority, we obey because we are convinced that the authority is absolutely right even if we don't really understand his purpose.

On the other hand, when there's a bad attitude it's also clear that obedience is forced. Forcing someone to do something it's not an effective way to execute authority in the long term, because there are a lot of different situations that are impossible to control from the human perspective. That's why when we think about the effectiveness of an authority, we should understand that even if the authority is not present; people is willing to act as if it was present.

## How to become authority

Authority implies power and all existing authorities represent power, but there are three ways to obtain such power:

  1. Fear
  2. Admiration
  3. Tradition

### Fear

Fear is the most basic one because at first it doesn't require any interaction just perception. Imagine you're walking the street and someone is comming your way, and let's say this person has marks on his face, is taller than you and looks like a bodybuilder. In my case, my first impression is fear, not because I'm thinking that this person is going to do harm me, but because I recognize myself in a physical disadvantage; it may be because of I see a big difference between heights, or muscles, or my lack of ability to fight, plus, if I think about the marks on his face; two things come to my mind: whether this person is really unlucky and had a lot of accidents, or those marks are product of recurrent fights, in either case this person isn't actually doing anything but everything is inside my head.

In this example just because I perceive myself weaker than him and I don't like to be damaged, I'll try to avoid any possible conflict, people call this effect _"survival instinct"_. However, if this person threatens me I'll try to obey as much as possible, not because I like it but because I fear what would happen if don't obey.

Even if fear is a possible way to obtain authority, the natural instinct of human beings is to overcome difficulties, that means; eventually fear won't be enough to keep an effective authority.

I think teenagers fits this particular case, there's some age where people start to think individually and develop some personal meaning to anything and therefore start to question everything; this produces the urge to judge any order received; here I've seen a lot of fathers trying to manipulate his kids by using some kind of fear against them: restricting videogames, forcing them to do chores at home, blackmailing them by prohibiting them doing something they like, etc... but, this doesn't last long, it's not effective, and sooner or later fathers discover they have lost authority over their kids.

Following the example above, I want to compare two kind of authorities that force people to obey by applying fear, one of them of course is parents and other one is a dictator. In both cases, if anyone decides not to obey they applies fear but the difference is their limits, a dictator is effective because no one can go against him unless there's a force greater than him but, parents are limited by the laws that defend their kids, so parents can't actually do anything that goes against a greater authority as the civilian laws.

My thought is that the only way to keep an effective authority ruled by fear, is by having no restrictions at all, that way it's possible to inflict pain in different and multiple ways. Pain is the only thing that it's not possible to resist no matter how much anyone tries it. However, at the same it's impossible for any human being to last long enough with this power, there's always the risk that some bigger power might fight over for the same position, there is the possibility for a treason specially considering that all human beings are helpless when sleeping, also, people might prefer to commit suicide before keep obeying any single order.

### Admiration

Another way to obtain power is through admiration, which I personally think is the most effective one. When people obey orders because of admiration there is always a pleasant attitude from the obeying part, a willingness to step forward and be the first one to obey, this is the kind of power you'll notice in what is commonly know as _"natural leaders"_.

## Two different authorities with same hierarchy can't coexist.

## Recap

At this point we have a lot of information about authority; let's recap a little bit and see what we have already:
  1. We are always obeying an authority, that includes our own will as authority.
  2. There's a hierarchy between authorities, there's always a higher authority.
  3. We decide the hierarchy of our authorities.
