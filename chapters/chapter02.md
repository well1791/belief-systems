## How do we develop a belief system?

Developing a belief system is quite confusing at first but completely logic, here are the steps that will help you understand a lot better your current belief systems:

  1. Authority
  2. Source
  3. Judgement

The list above should include a fourth one: **Act** but, that step doesn't really need a deep explanation. However, the first one in the list: **Authority**, is the base of everything. Hopefully by understanding the first concept, the rest of the steps will become easier.

### Authority

As this is the most important concept on this book, this chapter could take a lot of pages to fully describe what it implies but, I'll try my best to be concise and provide as many clear examples as I could.

Authority is the ability to give orders, and of course, expect them to be fulfilled; otherwise authority makes no sense. The word authority is directly related with two other words: obedience and will. First, if there is no obedience then authority is not effective, which means; there's no authority at all. Second, if there is no will then there is no order, hence, there's no need for authority.

The relationship between "authority" and "will" is always implicit; in fact, any time we follow an order, we are fulfilling someone else's will. On the other hand, "obedience" is the most effective way to recognize authority; when we obey it's because we consider that some order came from an authority. But, then what happens when we disobey?

Answer is: we are always obeying an authority whether we like it or not.

When we disobey an authority is just because there's a higher authority we want to obey, so in the end we actually choose to obey the authority we like the most. Now you may think: "Well, in my experience I can decide wheter to obey or not orders from the same authority, I don't really have obey all orders from a specific authority". Fair enough but, the thing is: If you disobey someone, you're actually obeying someone else, and that "someone else" could be our own will. The moment you think that some rule or command from the current authority doesn't looks good or right, you're judging authority based on your own criteria, and if your criteria is more convincing, in the end you'll end up obeying to yourself, to your own will.

## How to become authority

Authority implies power, all existing authorities represent power, but there are two ways to obtain such power:

  1. Fear
  2. Admiration
  3. Tradition

Fear is the most basic one because at first it doesn't require any interaction just perception. Imagine you're walking in the street and someone is comming your way, and let's say this person has marks on his face, is taller than you and looks like a bodybuilder. In my case, my first impression is a bit of fear, not because I'm thinking that person is bad but because I recognize myself in a physical disadvantage; maybe because of his height and muscles (and my lack of ability to fight of course), then, if I think about the marks on his face; two things come to my mind: whether this person is really unlucky and had a lot of accidents, or those marks are product of recurrent fights.

In this example just because I perceive myself weaker than him and I don't like to be damaged, I'll try to avoid any possible conflict, it's the nature of survival, so, if this person demands something I'll try obey as much as possible, not because I like it but because I fear what would happen if don't obey.

## Two different authorities with same hierarchy can't coexist.

## Obedience implies conviction

## Recap

At this point we have a lot of information about authority; let's recap a little bit and see what we have already:
  1. We are always obeying an authority, that includes our own will as authority.
  2. There's a hierarchy between authorities, there's always a higher authority.
  3. We decide the hierarchy of our authorities.

I think it's fair enough to say that at certain age, we all tend to trust more on our own authority than any other authority but, when do we start developing our own criteria?
