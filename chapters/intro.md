# Introduction

Through the years lots of people have invested time and effort defining an objective meaning for human existence (and anything it implies): civilization, society, behavior, religion, language, consciousness, etc. But, most of them differs in different ways of thinking, either at the beginning or the end of their ideas, those _"little"_ differences are one of the many reasons why we have a lot of ideas and meanings to the same words like _"happiness"_ or _"loneliness"_ (amont others); it's like there's no concrete meaning.

We are complex beings: we love to create, to excel and compete, to explore, to teach and learn, and much more; so, the more we learn the more we change and everytime we change; it changes our mind, ideas, meanings, convictions, etc. Consider this: When we are kids we start seeing the world with lenses _A_ and take decisions with them, we grow up a little bit and learn _B_ then we change _A_ to _B_, later on we find _C_ and _D_, for some people the solution is to mix them together so now there's a new _E_ lenses, but that's not enough and we keep trying new ones through the years, and with all this we end up want explaining and understanding our life (past, present and future) through different multicolor lenses. The world really messes our mind, and for some people this mess works but, for the most it doesn't make any single sense and they complain about their decisions and their current situation.

However, even though it's understandable and normal to accept failures and move on when we learn complex ideas such as _"happiness"_, the problem is that we don't just learn a lot of these ideas but we teach them, and a couple of years later these (back in the days) _"accepted ideas"_ turn out to be (nowadays) _"not accepted"_. In any case, I think we all agreed in this: The process of living involves **change** and **uncertainty**, and these variables are supposed to be constant until the very end of our lives, there is no solution for that but, we are always preparing for anything and everything, and if we are not prepared, we learn to deal with each and every unthinkable situation until we overcome.

There's something that doesn't fit. Now, before you continue reading there's something you must know about this book:

  * it won't teach you a new phisolophy
  * it won't teach you how to deal with any kind of situations
  * it won't teach you what is good or bad for your life
  * it won't teach you a new trick to cheat the system and get free coins

The purpose of this book, is to help you understand what you already believe.

Also, just to finish this introduction, we were talking about a lot aobut subjective ideas, you might ask: _"What about science?"_. Here's the answer: Even _"Science"_ is partially reliable; in fact, the mere existence of obsoleted theories is enough to demonstrate its realiability but, notice I said _"partially"_, that's because even with _"some truth"_ people is able to do amazing things.
