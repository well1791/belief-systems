# Introduction

Through the years lots of people have invested time and effort defining an objective meaning for human existence (and everything it implies): civilization, society, behavior, religion, language, consciousness, etc. But, most of them differs in different ways of thinking, either at the beginning or the end, those differences are one of the many reasons why we have a lot of ideas and meanings to the same words like _"happiness"_ or _"loneliness"_.

That's because we are complex beings: we love to create, to excel and compete, to explore, to teach and learn, and much more; so, the more we learn the more we change and everytime we change, our mind changes, our ideas, meanings and convictions too. Now, think of this as a self-test: When we are kids we start with lenses _A_ and take decisions with them, we grow up a little and change _A_ to _B_, later we pick _C_ and _D_ at the same time, then we mix them and now there's our own new _E_, but that's not enough so we keep trying new ones, and with all this test and try, we want explain and understand our life (past, present and future) through different lenses. The world really messes our mind, and for some people this mess works but, for the most it doesn't make any single sense and they complain about their decisions.

However, even though it's understandable and normal to accept failures with complex ideas shuch as the meaning of _"happiness"_, the problem is that we just don't only learn a lot of these ideas but we teach them, and a couple of years later these (back in the days) _"accepted ideas"_ turns out to be (nowadays) _"bad"_. But, reality is: The process of living involves **change** and **uncertainty**, and these variables are supposed to be constant until the very end of our lives, and there is no solution to that; in fact, we are always preparing for anything and everything, and if we are not prepared, we learn to deal with each and every unthinkable situation until we overcome.

But, there's something that doesn't fit. Now, before you continue reading there's something you must know about this book:
  * it won't teach you a new phisolophy
  * it won't teach you how to deal with any kind of situations
  * it won't teach you what is good or bad for your life
  * it won't teach you a new trick to cheat the system and get free coins
The purpose of this book, is to help you understand what you already believe.

Also, just to finish this introduction, we were talking about a lot aobut subjective ideas, you might ask: _"What about science?"_. Here's the answer: Even _"Science"_ is partially reliable; in fact, the mere existence of obsoleted theories is enough to demonstrate its realiability but, notice I said _"partially"_, that's because even with _"some truth"_ people is able to do amazing things.
