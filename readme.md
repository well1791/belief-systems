### Belief Systems

This is a personal project, my goal is to organize my ideas about belief systems pragmatically. The content touches concepts from philosophy, theology, and psychology from my perspective. However, some ideas may be explained in deep by other authors for which I haven't taken the time to read them, in those cases I won't try to get any credit as that's not my field of study but, as I don't know how much my ideas may overlap with someone else's ideas, I'll be grateful if anyone let me know about such cases. Also, if I know that some concepts are better explained by some authors, I'll make sure to quote them.
